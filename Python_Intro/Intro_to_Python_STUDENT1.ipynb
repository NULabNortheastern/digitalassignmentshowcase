    "It is increasingly important to learn a scripting language, such as Python or R, in order to access, collect, and structure data from diverse sources, and analyze data using new and developing methods, such as machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lecture and hands-on workshop I will provide a brief introduction to the scripting language Python, using the Jupyter platform (what you're looking at now), with an eye toward data representation and analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "I am going to throw a lot of syntax at you. There is no way you will remember all of this. Keep your notes, and my notes, as a reference. Focus on learning the syntax, but also getting a higher-level understanding of the way Python works. The syntax will come as you work with it more. If you've never written in Python, all of this may feel very strange to you. It gets easier as you work with it more.\n",
