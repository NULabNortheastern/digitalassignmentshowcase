    "\n",
    "It is increasingly important to learn a scripting language, such as Python or R, in order to access, collect, and structure data from diverse sources, and analyze data using new and developing methods, such as machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is no way you will remember all of this and that is completely normal. Focus on learning the syntax, but also getting a higher-level understanding of the way Python works. This is just a basic introduction to understand how python works and what you can do with it, but there are a lot of resources out there if this is something that interests you. If you've never written in Python, all of this may feel very strange to you. It gets easier as you work with it more.\n",
