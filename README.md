# Digital Assignment Showcase

This repository holds the materials for the Digital Teaching Integration initiative, led by the NULab for Texts, Maps, and Networks at Northeastern University. The goal of the Digital Teaching Integration is to integrate digital methods into courses in a way that mirrors the themes of the course and can enhance digital literacies. 

Each folder contains the materials for the different courses and is labeled by the theme of the material. For example, the "Introduction to Computational Social Science" folder contains classroom materials used in a Sociology course, introduction to research methods. This ReadMe will contain basic information about what materials be found in each folder, in what settings it might be useful, and what tools/expertises may be needed.

These resources and materials have been created by Sarah Connell, Cara Marta Messina, Laura Nelson, and Alexis Yohros.
