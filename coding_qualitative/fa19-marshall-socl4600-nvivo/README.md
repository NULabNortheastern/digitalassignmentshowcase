## Summary of Module
The first day of this module will go over the steps to conducting research on first years’ experiences at Northeastern by introducing survey and interview analysis tools. Specifically, this module will introduce Google Forms to create a collaborative survey; students will come to class with their potential questions, create their surveys in small groups, and then take everyone’s survey. 

The second day of the module will ask students to choose one person to interview, transcribe that interview, and qualitatively code it using Nvivo. For this portion, we will use sample transcript excerpts as well as the students’ transcripts of their interviews to practice qualitative coding and visualizing results with NVivo. 

## Learning Goals
<strong>Day 1: Survey Creation and Analysis</strong>
- Understand how to formulate different types of research questions, from open-ended to likert scale
- Understand how to use Google Forms to collaboratively create a survey and view/analyze the results
- Understand how to do follow-up questions for more interesting answers

<strong>Day 2: Qualitative Coding with NVivo</strong>
- Define qualitative coding and why it can be useful while doing research
- Understand what NVivo is as a research tool and what it can do
- Learn important NVivo-specific vocabulary to aid independent research 

## Learning Objectives
<strong>Day 1: Survey Creation and Analysis</strong>
- Build a collaborative survey in a small group using Google Forms
- Learn how to analyze the results on Google Sheets using basic functions like formulas or charts

<strong>Day 2: Qualitative Coding with NVivo</strong>
- Create a basic set of nodes using sample transcripts
- Learn out to import data, create nodes, code data, and see/interpret results of coding
- Use Nvivo to begin creating nodes and coding their own interview transcripts
