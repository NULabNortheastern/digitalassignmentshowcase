## Summary of Module
This module will ask students to choose one person to interview, transcribe that interview, and qualitatively code it using Nvivo. For this portion, we will use sample transcript excerpts as well as the studentsâ€™ transcripts of their interviews to practice qualitative coding and visualizing results with NVivo.

## Learning Goals
- Define qualitative coding and why it can be useful while doing research
- Understand what NVivo is as a research tool and what it can do
- Learn important NVivo-specific vocabulary to aid independent research

## Learning Objectives
- Create a basic set of nodes using sample transcripts
- Learn out to import data, create nodes, code data, and see/interpret results of coding
- Use Nvivo to begin creating nodes and coding their own interview transcripts
