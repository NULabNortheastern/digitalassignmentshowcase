As a reminder, functions are structured such that the function name is followed by a set of parentheses `()`. Inside the parentheses are any [arguments](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#argument) that the functions operate on. We say that arguments are **passed** to the function when it is run. \n","\n","Depending on the function (and your goals for using it), a function may accept no arguments, a single argument, or many arguments. \n","\n","When we introduced functions, we noted that there are three kinds:\n","* Native functions built into Python\n","* Functions others have written that you can import\n","* Functions you write yourself\n","\n","Just as a quick refresher, run the code cell below to use the built-in `type()` function.

Adding them all to Python would create mass confusion, since many people could use the same name for functions that do different things. The solution then is that functions are stored in [modules](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#module) that can be **imported** for use. A module is a Python file (extension \".py\") that contains the definitions for the functions written in Python. These modules can then be collected into even larger groups called [packages](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#package) and [libraries](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#library).
