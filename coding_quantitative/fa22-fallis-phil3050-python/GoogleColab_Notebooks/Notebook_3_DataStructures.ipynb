        "So far, we've seen a few of Python's inbuilt data types: integers, floats, and strings. **We've also used lists without fully defining them. This lesson will talk about how lists store data**, and cover two additional data types: [tuples](https://constellate.org/docs/key-terms/#tuple) and [dictionaries](https://constellate.org/docs/key-terms/#dictionary). These help us store many values inside of a single variable.\n",

        "The fundamental difference between a tuple and a dictionary is that a tuple stores items in sequential order (starting from 0) while a dictionary stores items in key/value pairs. When we want to retrieve an item in a tuple, we use an index number or a set of index numbers as a reference. When we want to retrieve an item from a dictionary, we supply a key that returns the value (or set of values) associated with that key. Another important difference is that tuples are **immutable**, which means they can't be changed, but dictionaries are **mutable** and can be changed after they are initialized.\n",
