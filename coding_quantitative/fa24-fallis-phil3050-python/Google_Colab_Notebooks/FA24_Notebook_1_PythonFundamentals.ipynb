Code Cells — These can contain code written in a variety of programming languages. The text within these cells will be executed by the compiler as code.

Your public-facing comments should be written to explain how the code is expected to behave, point out the rationale behind your design decisions, and mark out places where a user might want to modify the code. The comments you make as you are learning can be used to explain how the code works to yourself, and to mark any questions you have or places you got stuck.

You won't solve the puzzle if you're afraid to test if the pieces match. The best approach to working through a large puzzle is to break it into smaller, more managable pieces and to solve it a piece at a time. An error message will not break your computer.
