This notebook will discuss data structures. These help us store many values inside of a single variable. We will mainly focus on [tuples](https://constellate.org/docs/key-terms/#tuple) and [dictionaries](https://constellate.org/docs/key-terms/#dictionary) as you will use these in your Dunkin assignments. At the end, we will also briefly touch on [lists](https://constellate.org/docs/key-terms/#list) and [sets](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_sets.asp).  \n","\n","The fundamental difference between a tuple and a dictionary is that a tuple stores items in sequential order (starting from 0) while a dictionary stores items in key/value pairs. When we want to retrieve one or more items from a tuple, we use an index number or a set of index numbers as a reference. When we want to retrieve an item from a dictionary, we supply a key that returns the value associated with that key. Another important difference is that tuples are **immutable**, which means they can't be changed, but dictionaries are **mutable**, which means they can be changed after they are initialized.\n","\n","Each of these data structures can be beneficial depending on what kind of data we are working with, and what we intend to do with the data.\n","\n","For your class assignments using Python, you will be asked to work with data that is stored in dictionaries and tuples.
