In these lessons, you've learned the basics of Python, such as variables, functions, and expressions. We've covered how to write loops and how to construct conditional statements that produce different outcomes based on different inputs. We've also learned how to write our own functions and worked with data structures like dictionaries and tuples.\n","\n","This is a lot, but it's also just the very beginning of what is possible with Python. There are many resources for learning Python aimed at humanities students. For example, [Python for Everybody](https://www.py4e.com/) and the [tutorials](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/?topic=python) developed by the Programming Historian project are great places to start. W3Schools also has some [tutorials](https://www.w3schools.com/python/default.asp) on Python that provide clear outlines of core concepts, with examples you can work through.\n","\n","If you would like to work with Python on your own computer, there are several options. Probably the easiest is to download [Anaconda Navigator](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/navigator/index.html). With Anaconda, you can access several platforms for editing code—these include not just the Jupyter Notebooks environment that is similar to what we've been doing with Google Colab but also [Spyder](https://www.spyder-ide.org/), which allows you to edit Python (.py) files directly.\n","\n","Before you're done with this lesson, though, there are a few exercises. As always, we encourage you to read through the full lesson again and try running the suggested code activities and modifying the code samples.\n","\n","You should take a minute to congratulate yourself on how much you have learned about Python in the last few weeks!
