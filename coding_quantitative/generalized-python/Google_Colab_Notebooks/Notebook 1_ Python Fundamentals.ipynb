A cell is like a container for a particular kind of content. There are essentially two kinds of content in notebooks:\n","\n","1. Text Cells—These can contain text, images, video, and the other kinds of explanatory content you might find on a regular website. The cell you're reading right now is a text cell. Text cells are written in what is called **markdown**, which is a lightweight method for formatting text.\n","2. Code Cells—These can contain code written in a variety of languages.\n","\n","A **code cell** can be distinguished from a **text cell** by the fact that it contains a pair of brackets on its left.

In the Google Colab default view, comments are green.\n","\n","When you are learning code, commenting is *essential*; you should add comments to explain to yourself what the code is doing, to mark any questions that you have, and to remind yourself where you left off in your work (an important rule of coding is that your future self will not remember anything). Commenting is also a responsible practice for any code that you might produce and share in the future. Your public-facing comments should be written to explain how the code is expected to behave, point out the rationale behind your design decisions, and mark out places where a user might want to modify the code. The comments you make as you are learning can be used to explain how the code works to yourself, and to mark any questions you have or places you got stuck."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"yDKCuoLB9XgD"},"source":["### Hello World: Your First Code\n","\n","It is traditional in programming education to begin with a program that prints ``Hello World``. In Python, this is a simple task using the ``print()`` function. A function is a block of code that performs some action—we will cover functions in more detail below.

You won't solve the puzzle if you're afraid to test if the pieces match. An error message will not break your computer. Google Colab can also help you spot mistakes in your code by underlining them in red.
