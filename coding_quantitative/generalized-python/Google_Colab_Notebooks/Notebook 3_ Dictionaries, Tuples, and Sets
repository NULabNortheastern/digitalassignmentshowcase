This lesson will cover three additional data types: dictionaries, tuples, and sets. These help us store many values inside of a single variable.

We have seen that the items of a list are stored in a strictly-ordered fashion, starting from item 0. In a dictionary, each **value** is stored in relation to a descriptive **key** forming a **key/value pair**. This structure often makes it easier to look information up, because you can supply a key and receive a value without needing to refer to a specific index number. You are not allowed to have duplicate keys in Python dictionaries; each key can be used only once.\n","\n","Whereas a list is typed with square backets `[]`, a dictionary is typed with braces (also called curly brackets) `{}`.
