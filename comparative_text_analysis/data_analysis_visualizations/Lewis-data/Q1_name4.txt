Name4's writing is beautiful. They talked a lot, but not necessarily always about the writing. Our conversations reminded me a bit of Name2 and I tried to make sure I was asking Name4 about their personal life and their feelings toward writing. When I tried to steer the conversation towards writing, though, they talked less and seemed less engaged. They would usually answer with one or two words. When I pointed out something I really liked in a descriptive paragraph, though, they got very excited and began explaining why they wrote such a heavy description. I encouraged them to keep writing and maybe look at some poetry!
