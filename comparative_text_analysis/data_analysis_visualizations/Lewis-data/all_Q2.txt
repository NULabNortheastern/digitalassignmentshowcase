I practiced asking more questions. When the student asked me a question, I rephrased their question and asked it back so we could problem solve together.
I realized asking questions about Name2's life helped to open them up more. Sometimes barriers to writing are not necessarily about the writing itself, but about other contexts that make wrting feel impossible or scary. I think I will engage more with students about their personal lives and feelings.
I learned to give students space to write. Sometimes, the best thing I can do is to be there for accountability purposes. I was really proud of Name3. 
I learned to incorporate praise more when working with students. Name4's face lit up when I got authentically excited about their creative writing.
