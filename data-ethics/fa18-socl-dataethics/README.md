# Introduction to Computational Social Sciences

## This module will go over:
- What do we mean when we say "computational social sciences"
- Examples of computational social sciences
- Why it is applicable to students or why students should learn about it
- How we can incorporate computational social sciences into work or research

## Class Info
Various Introduction to Sociology courses and retrests taught between Spring and Fall 2018 at Northeastern.

## Summary of Module

Introduction to Computational Social Sciences provides a brief overview and set of activities for students to learn what computational social sciences means, how it appears in our daily lives, and why it is important to learn about it. The various iterations of this module are made on Jupyter Notebook. 

## Learning Objectives and Outcomes
- Introduce data collection and analytics
- Familiarize yourself with what Python can do
- Explore how data is collected through applications like Facebook and Google and how these could be applied to the social sciences
- Provide examples for how data can reinforce or challenge beliefs and narratives
- Discuss how this data can represent patterns in human behavior and how this data can reflect problematic power structures and biases
- Examine the moral and ethical implications of “big data”
