## Summary of Module
This module will introduce what “big data” and the ethical questions that surround big data. Big data is the collection of mass amounts of data and the quick analysis of this data to categorize and re-categorize patterns of behavior. These categories often have underlying ideologies that may or may not demonstrate implicit bias. The module then connects this to research methods, specifically asking students to think about their own choices when doing research. The final part of the module is a short activity that asks students to think about how an application for adopting a dog may hold particular biases. 

Specifically, this module will discuss China's social credit system and use the "Adopt or Not" activity to demonstrate the logics of machine learning and the biases embedded in this process.

## Learning Goals

- Understand the ways in which technology reflects cultural, social, and political biases. 
- Explore the ways in which privacy and security are being reshaped and redefined through the use of big data, algorithms, and policy

## Learning Objectives
- Define “big data” and point to different digital technologies that rely on this type of collection and analysis.
- Find personal data collected on users through Facebook, Google, Instagram, and more.
