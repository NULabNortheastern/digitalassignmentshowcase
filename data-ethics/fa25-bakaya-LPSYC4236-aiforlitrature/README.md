<h2>Summary of Module</h2>

This module will introduce ethics, including what big data is and how it works, algorithmic bias, and questions and guidelines for ethical research. Big data is the collection of mass amounts of data and the programmatic analysis of this data to categorize and re-categorize patterns of behavior. Algorithms can reinforce implicit and potentially harmful biases, including biases in the data used and collected for algorithms, the choices made in algorithm creation, and the impact of those choices on the people using and being affected by these algorithms in the real world. Particularly, this module looks at biases in academia and the use of non-traditional and non-academic sources in research and writing.

<h2>Workshop Objectives</h2>

* Understand the ways data is being used in society as well as how algorithms impact and shape our daily lives.
* Explore the ways in which privacy and security are being reshaped and redefined through the use of big data, algorithms, and policy.
* Understand the ways in which data reflects and reinforces cultural, social, and political biases. 
* Explore ways of interpreting and effectively utilizing data-based evidence in written arguments.
