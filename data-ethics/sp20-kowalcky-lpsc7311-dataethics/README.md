## Summary of Module
This module will discuss data ethics, big data, and the biases embedded in the everyday algorithms we use to shape policy knowledge and make public policy decisions. Big data is the collection of mass amounts of data and the quick analysis of this data to categorize and re-categorize patterns of behavior. These categories often have underlying ideologies that may or may not demonstrate implicit bias. This module has too activities: (1) a short activity that asks students to think about how an application for adopting a dog may hold particular biases, and (2) a build an algorithm activity where students will think about how an algorithm may work and where it will get its data to address a specific policy problem. This module also discusses two assigned readings.

## Learning Goals
- Understand the ways data is being used in society as well as how algorithms impact and shape our daily lives
- Understand the ways in which technology reflects cultural, social, and political biases.
- Explore the ways in which privacy and security are being reshaped and redefined through the use of big data, algorithms, and policy
 -Explore the ways in which these questions and methods are influencing how policymakers gather data, make decisions, and the effect algorithms may have on the public.

## Learning Objectives
- Detail what big data is and how it being used
- Understand what an algorithm is and does
- Discuss the ways data is being used in society as well as how algorithms impact and shape our daily lives.
- Consider the ways in which technologies reflect cultural, social, and political biases.
- Explore algorithmic transparency solutions and policymaker’s role
