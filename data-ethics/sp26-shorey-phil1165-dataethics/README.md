<h2>Summary of Module</h2>

This module will introduce ethics, including what big data is and how it works, algorithmic bias, and questions and guidelines for ethical research. Big data is the collection of mass amounts of data and the programmatic analysis of this data to categorize and re-categorize patterns of behavior. Algorithms can reinforce implicit and potentially harmful biases, including biases in the data used and collected for algorithms, the choices made in algorithm creation, and the impact of those choices on the people using and being affected by these algorithms in the real world. Particularly, this module looks at moral and social considerations for research that involves health data.

<h2>Workshop Objectives</h2>

* Understand the ways in which data reflects and reinforces cultural, social, and political biases.
* Explore ways of interpreting and effectively utilizing data-based evidence in written arguments.
* Explore moral and social considerations for working with big data, algorithms, and AI in healthcare spaces.
* Explore the ways in which these questions and methods are influencing how humanists and social scientists do research.
