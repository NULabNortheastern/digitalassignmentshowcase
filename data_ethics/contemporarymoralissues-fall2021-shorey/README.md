#### Summary of Module

This module will introduce “big data” and the ethical questions that surround big data. Big data is the collection of mass amounts of data and the quick analysis of this data to categorize and re-categorize patterns of behavior. These categories often have underlying ideologies that may or may not demonstrate implicit bias. Discussion around a course-specific case study of Skid Row and using data to inform policy on the homelessness problem in Los Angeles rounds out the module.
