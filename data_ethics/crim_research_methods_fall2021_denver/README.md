## Summary of Module
This module will introduce what “big data” is and cover the ethical questions that surround big data. Big data is the collection of mass amounts of data and the quick analysis of this data to categorize and re-categorize patterns of behavior. These categories often have underlying ideologies that may or may not demonstrate implicit bias. This module has a short activity that asks students to think about how an application for adopting a dog may hold particular biases. Finally, the module then connects these topics to research methods, specifically asking students to think about their own choices when doing research.

## Learning Goals
- Understand the ways data is being used in society as well as how algorithms impact and shape our daily lives
- Understand the ways in which technology reflects cultural, social, and political biases
- Explore the ways in which privacy and security are being reshaped and redefined through the use of big data, algorithms, and policy
- Explore the ways in which these questions and methods are influencing how humanists and social scientists do research and practice their craft


## Learning Objectives
- Define “big data” and point to different digital technologies that rely on this type of collection and analysis.
- Find personal data collected on users through Facebook, Google, Instagram, and more.
- Tackle questions about implicit bias to be considered when conducting research, especially collecting and analyzing data.
