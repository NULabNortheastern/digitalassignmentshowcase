## Summary of Module
This module will introduce what “big data” and the ethical questions that surround big data. Big data is the collection of mass amounts of data and the quick analysis of this data to categorize and re-categorize patterns of behavior. Using big data’s categorizing system as an example, students will then begin to think about how they categorize their own writing behaviors using Google Sheets. This module will introduce Google Sheets and some of its basic functions, and ask students to critically reflect on the types of ways they might categorize their own writing practices.

## Learning Goals
