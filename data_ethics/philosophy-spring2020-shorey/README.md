## Summary of Module
This module will introduce what “big data” and the ethical questions that surround big data. Big data is the collection of mass amounts of data and the quick analysis of this data to categorize and re-categorize patterns of behavior. These categories often have underlying ideologies that may or may not demonstrate implicit bias. The module then connects this to research methods, specifically asking students to think about their own choices when doing research. 

Specifically, this module will discuss China's DNA sureveillance, similar technologies in America, and the ethics beehind these technologies.
