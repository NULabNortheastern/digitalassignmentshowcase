## Summary of Module
This module will introduce ethics, including what big data is and how it works, algorithmic bias, and questions and guidelines for ethical research. Big data is the collection of mass amounts of data and the quick analysis of this data to categorize and re-categorize patterns of behavior. In order to introduce algorithms, this module uses the mini in-class activity “Is it a Plant?” Algorithmic bias explores how these algorithms can reinforce implicit and potentially harmful biases, including biases in the data used and collected for algorithms, the choices made in algorithm creation, and the impact. Particularly, this module looks at algorithms in the criminal justice system, including recidivism algorithms. Finally, this module will then move to discussing how implicit biases may exist in our own research practices and questions we can ask to combat these. 

## Learning Goals
- Understand the ways in which technologies reflect cultural, social, and political biases. 
- Explore the basic process for machine learning algorithms 
- Understand the ways data is being used in society as well as how algorithms impact and shape our daily lives and the criminal justice system
- Explore the ways in which these questions and methods are influencing how humanists and social scientists do research and practice their craft

## Learning Objectives
- Define “big data” and point to different digital technologies that rely on this type of collection and analysis.
- Create a mini rule-based classifier and discuss important vocabulary like boolean logic, overfitting, and underfitting 
- Point to algorithms that are used to make important decisions, like risk assessment algorithms and targeted advertising
- Tackle questions about implicit bias to be used when conducting research, especially collecting and analyzing data.
