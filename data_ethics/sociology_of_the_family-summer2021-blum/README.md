### Summary of Module

This module will introduce “big data” and algorithms, and the ethical questions that surround these systems. Big data is the massive amount of data collected and stored every day, and algorithms provide ways to analyze these data and to categorize and re-categorize patterns of behavior. These categories often have underlying ideologies that may demonstrate implicit or explicit biases. The module connects these issues to sociology of the family, and foster care systems in the US more specifically. Students will engage in a guided discussion of these topics in relation to relevant class readings.

### Learning Goals

- Understand the ways data is being used in society as well as how algorithms impact and shape our daily lives.
- Understand the ways in which technology reflects cultural, social, and political biases. 
- Explore the ways in which privacy and security are being reshaped and redefined through the use of big data, algorithms, and policy.
- Explore the ways in which these questions and methods are influencing how humanists and social scientists do research and practice their craft.

### Learning Objectives

- Define “big data” and point to different digital technologies that rely on this type of collection and analysis.
- Tackle questions about implicit bias to be used when conducting research, especially collecting and analyzing data.
