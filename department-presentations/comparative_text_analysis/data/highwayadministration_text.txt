INTRODUCTION
This memorandum focuses on the use of climate information when performing a vulnerability
assessment, a topic that was discussed at the Newark Pilot Peer Exchange Workshop on May 4-5,
2011. The memorandum describes several sources of climate information,1 and provides some
recommendations on how this information can be used by the pilots (or other transportation
planners) as they consider their climate-related risks.
The memorandum is organized into three sections:




Information about Historical Climate
Information about Future Climate
Sources of Technical Assistance

The memorandum also has an Appendix which outlines some of the methods being employed by
pilots to estimate the impacts of sea-level rise.
HISTORICAL CLIMATE
VALUE OF EXAMINING HISTORICAL CLIMATE
Analysis of historical climate allows decision makers to better understand and communicate the
projected changes in climate and their associated impacts. The following sections discuss three
specific types of benefits that can emerge from the analysis of historical climate:




Information on the extent and magnitude of a transportation system’s sensitivity, which
can be used to consider the response of the system to climate change;
Variability in temperature and precipitation conditions, which provides context for
judging the magnitude of future climate changes; and
Case studies of weather events that matter to the community. These examples can be
valuable communication tools to raise awareness of climate risks to a variety of
audiences.

Sensitivity
In many locations, the temperature and precipitation patterns of the 21st century are likely to be
considerably different than those experienced in the 20th century. However, the ability to
anticipate the consequences of climate change on transportation services and assets will draw
heavily on agencies’ experiences regarding their performance in the past climate, especially
during extreme conditions (e.g., heat waves, heavy rainfall events). Understanding how
transportation systems have performed during periods of high temperature, heavy precipitation
and flooding, or prolonged lack of precipitation can provide qualitative, and in some cases,
quantitative information that can be extrapolated to future climate conditions.

In this memorandum, discussion of “climate” will remain focused on temperature and precipitation. This
is consistent with the discussion of climate information that took place during the Breakout Session at the
Newark Pilot Peer Exchange workshop, May 4-5, 2011. As such, other aspects of climate (e.g.,
atmospheric circulation patterns, ocean currents, streamflow, snowpack) will not be discussed at length in
this memorandum. Although some of these other aspects of climate may affect transportation
infrastructure, the applicability, reliability, and availability of data will be highly variable from location to
location; temperature and precipitation, on the other hand, will likely need to be considered in any
vulnerability assessment.

The following questions are examples of the way in which past climate information can be
employed to identify this type of sensitivity information:







Which types of services or assets are currently affected by weather extremes?
Have heat waves, floods, or droughts recently caused service disruptions or damage to
assets?
Are there service disruptions or damage to assets associated with more subtle or longerterm weather and climate events, such as a warmer-than-normal summer or a wetter-thannormal winter?
What is the nature of the service disruption or asset damage? Examples of types of
impacts include reduced service reliability, lower quality of service for travelers, and
increased repair or construction costs.
Are there particular locations within the transportation system that frequently suffer
impacts tied to storms or other weather events, or suffer the most significant impacts?
Are there thresholds (e.g., a specific high temperature, an amount of precipitation within
a day or over several days) at which the system begins to experience impacts?

Performing a sensitivity analysis can provide a foundation from which to identify future
vulnerabilities. In addition, it helps to identify the particular climate variables that should be
extracted from future climate projections (see discussion below) as part of the vulnerability
analysis. For example, if heat waves pose problems for a transportation service, then the model
projections for temperature during the spring, summer, and fall months should be investigated
closely (increases in winter temperatures are unlikely to result in “heat waves” for most
locations). Also, if heat waves are an issue, some attention should be paid to the daily-scale
temperature variability associated with model projections (see the Projection of daily-scale
extremes),2 in addition to the monthly and seasonal statistics.
Historical variability and the context for future changes
Examination of past climate allows future projections to be put into context. To illustrate the
importance of understanding historical variability, records of annual precipitation and average
annual temperature for a weather station in Pasadena, California are shown in Figures 1 and 2.
These graphs and the accompanying discussion show that a comparison between historical
variability and projected changes can be an important part of the assessment of local-scale
impacts.

Climate models’ ability to simulate the daily-scale statistics of climate in a particular region is limited.
Quantitative information derived from daily-scale statistics should be scrutinized and used with care (as
discussed further in the “Translating to Impacts” section). For example, changes in daily-scale extremes
can span a wide range – projections for California exhibit increases in the frequency of intense heat waves
ranging from a doubling or tripling to increases by a factor of 20 (Cayan et al., 2009). Although all models
and scenarios project a warmer future, including an increase in the frequency and intensity of heat waves,
there is significant uncertainty as to how this warming translates into daily-scale changes in weather in
particular locations across California.

Figure 1: Historical precipitation in Pasadena, California
Total annual precipitation (December –November) is shown for the period 1950-2009. The black line shows the average
rainfall (~20 inches per year). The gray lines show the averages for El Niño years (top gray line; wettest of the three
averages) and La Niña years (bottom gray line; driest of the three averages). The red dashed lines correspond to
hypothetical future increases and decreases in annual precipitation by 20%. The graph demonstrates that the year-to-year
variability of precipitation is very large relative to the average precipitation. Future changes in precipitation (+/- 4 inches)
are relatively small compared to the historical range, and the difference between the average of El Niño years and La Niña
years. Data taken from the NCDC/NOAA U.S. Historical Climate Network.
Note: total precipitation is calculated from December through November to prevent splitting winter months that
experience the same signal from El Niño-Southern Oscillation, as would be done by using the calendar years.

The precipitation graph demonstrates that the year-to-year variability of precipitation is very large
relative to the average precipitation (middle black line on the graph). Although such variability is
not representative of most stations across the country, many locations in Southern California
exhibit this level of variability. For Southern California (and much of the U.S. West Coast), the
El Niño-Southern Oscillation has a significant impact on precipitation falling during the winter,
which in turn has a significant impact on annual precipitation. For Pasadena, the average
precipitation falling during El Niño years is 10 inches greater than the average for the La Niña
years.3
Understanding this variability can help to put future changes in context. Although climate model
projections vary regarding the direction of future precipitation changes in Southern California,
many models show increases or decreases that are around 20% or less of average precipitation by
the 21st century. These changes (both increases and decreases) have been shown in the graph
above as red, dashed lines. Although these changes are not negligible, they clearly fall within the
range of historical variability. The projected changes are much smaller (by more than a factor of
2) than the difference between the averages for El Niño and La Niña years.

The relationship between El Niño-Southern Oscillation and precipitation in Southern California is
particularly strong. Many locations in the United States, especially away from the West Coast, will not
exhibit such a strong connection.

Figure 2: Historical temperature in Pasadena, California
Average annual temperature is shown for the period 1950-2009. The black line shows the average for the period 19611990. The red dashed line corresponds to a hypothetical increase in average annual temperature by 3°F. In comparison
to the precipitation graph, the hypothetical change in temperature, which is at the low end of projections for the end of
the 21st century, is large compared to the historical variability. Data taken from the NCDC/NOAA U.S. Historical
Climate Network.
Note: The black line only represents an average of a 30-year portion of the record. This was chosen because 1) the time
series as a whole has a linear trend toward warming, and 2) the late 20th century is often used as a baseline from which
warming is estimated from the output of climate models.

By comparison, the projection for future average temperature for Southern California (as shown
by the red, dashed line in Figure 2) is outside the range of historical conditions. The hypothetical
warming shown in Figure 2 is 3°F, which is at the low end of projections for the end of the 21st
century. Some models and scenarios project warming of 8°F.
The purpose of the Pasadena example is to demonstrate that consideration of historical variability
is an important component of an impacts assessment. Clearly, the increases anticipated for
temperature in Southern California represent a fundamental change in the regional climate by the
end of the 21st century. The projections for precipitation are both more uncertain (i.e., increases
or decreases could occur) and fall within the range of historical conditions. This is not to say that
the changes will be insignificant or negligible, but simply that the future average conditions are
likely to resemble a significant portion of the historical record. In addition, the analysis shows
that some of the year-to-year changes in precipitation may be worth considering as part of the
impacts assessment, or in the development of adaptation options (i.e., a system that is resilient to
some of the relatively large swings in historical year-to-year rainfall is also likely to be resilient to
longer term changes in precipitation).
It is important to emphasize that the variability represented in the Pasadena record is not
necessarily representative of other locations. In other places, the variability of precipitation is
likely to be smaller, such that a 20% change in precipitation could represent a more significant
difference from historical conditions. Similarly, other locations could exhibit greater temperature
variability, in which a warming of 3°F may appear less drastic. The diversity in climate
conditions across the country underscores the need to assess future climate projections in light of
historical regional climate variability.

Communication tool
Past weather events (e.g., strong storms, heat waves) or climate events (e.g,, droughts, warmerthan-normal summers, wetter-than-normal years) that have negatively affected the transportation
system can be used as examples to facilitate discussion with staff within a transportation agency
or with other groups external to the agency (e.g., political representatives, commuters, transit
riders). These examples can be important ways to raise awareness among these groups. Benefits
include:
Drawing on shared experience: Past weather and climate events represent a shared experience.
Within transportation agencies, this shared experience can be a valuable way to acquire
information on sensitivity. More broadly, these events can be a way to invite participation from
desired audiences, making the issue of climate change and climate impacts more personal and
less technical.
Identification of potential adaptive responses: Especially for internal staff audiences, the
experience of dealing with past weather and climate events can provide valuable information
about what does and does not work when attempting to minimize damage or maximize
opportunities associated with impacts. Past experience provides “lessons learned” that can help
spark and guide discussion about adaptation options.
Justification for action: Past examples can provide the answer to “why are you performing a
vulnerability assessment?” Discussion of the examples can help make the case that the
vulnerability assessment can help to reduce the risks associated with similar, repeat occurrences
of the examples.
Education regarding weather and climate: Aspects of the examples can help to educate staff or
the broader community about climate variability, climate change, and local-scale impacts.
Making the connection between weather and climate, in and of itself, is an important step toward
educating people about climate.
Alternative framing of climate-related initiatives: Among some audiences, the terms “climate”
and “climate change” are laden with significant political connotations. These connotations are
likely unrelated to, or at best are tangential to, the task of increasing the resilience of the
transportation system to extreme weather and climate impacts. Framing the vulnerability
assessment in terms of past weather and climate events can help to avoid some of these political
issues.
Limits of making extrapolations based on historical data
As outlined above, examination of historical climate data and observed impacts from weather and
climate events can be useful for both analysis of vulnerability and communication. However, it is
important to recognize a fundamental issue in considering climate change: the prevailing or
typical historical climate conditions are unlikely to be representative of the future climate
conditions. Although analysis of the past can yield useful “analogs” for certain types of weather
events, provide insights into the types of impacts that might occur (or might occur more
frequently), or serve as efficient communication tools, the climate is changing, and some future
climate impacts may go beyond the range of impacts that have occurred historically.
On a related note, care should also be taken when examining and making inferences from trends
in historical climate data. Although these trends can be informative when considering the types
of changes that may occur (e.g., warming over the last 30 years has accompanied a greater
frequency of heat waves), or in identifying sensitive infrastructure (e.g., the lifetimes of

6

Federal Highway Administration

equipment or infrastructure have been shrinking as a result of more frequent recent high
temperatures), it is unlikely that the trends of past decades will persist unchanged into the future.
In most cases, extending past trend lines into the future would represent a poor model of future
conditions, especially on longer timescales (greater than 30 to 40 years). For example, for all
parts of the U.S., the rates of warming for the 21st century are expected to be greater than the rate
of warming between 1900 and 2000. Moreover, for many scenarios of warming, the latter half of
the 21st century is likely to exhibit more rapid warming than the first half of the 21st century.
DATA SOURCES
Historical climate information can
be found in a variety of data
products that are maintained by the
National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration (NOAA). These
products fall into two general
categories:
Station Data – these records
correspond to a specific location.
NOAA’s National Weather
Service, in conjunction with
Figure 3: Locations of active COOP weather and climate
significant volunteer contributions,
stations
maintains the Cooperative Station
Network (COOP), which represents a large set of stations across the country (Figure 3), some of
which have relatively long periods of record (greater than 100 years). These stations have
observations for daily temperature, precipitation, and some provide measures of snowfall. A
subset of these stations, the U.S. Historical Climate Network has been quality controlled for use
in climatological research, and has over 1200 stations across the country
(http://cdiac.ornl.gov/epubs/ndp/ushcn/ushcn.html).
Station data portrays the daily and
monthly variability that has been
witnessed at a particular location,
including any extreme events that may
have occurred there. Such a record can
be particularly useful if it is nearby
transportation assets that are included in
the vulnerability assessment. However,
such a station’s record may not be
representative of larger regions.
Topography, differences in land cover,
the presence of water bodies, and
features of the average larger-scale
circulation can affect the extent to
which a station might be considered
representative of a larger area.

Climate Division Data
The National Climate Data Center (also a part of NOAA) maintains a climate division data set.
In these data, individual stations that fall in a region with a similar climate are averaged together.
A map of the 344 climate divisions is shown in Figure 4.
These data have better quality from 1931 to the present than earlier periods (data from 1895-1930
were sometimes based on state averages, rather than actual station observations). These data can
be useful for examining trends and variability over larger geographic areas, and avoid any issues
of data quality that might arise from looking at an individual station. However, only monthly and
annual data for temperature and precipitation are available.
Other Sources
There are many other sources of historical climate information for variables such as streamflow
(data from U.S. Geological Survey (USGS)), snowpack measurements (the National Resource
Conservation Service (NRCS), which is part of the U.S. Department of Agriculture), and gridded
“reanalysis” products for more complex meteorological variables (National Centers for
Environmental Prediction, which is part of NOAA).4 These data sets can be useful for assessing
some types of impacts, especially hydrological impacts such as droughts and floods. However,
we have restricted our discussion to those products that are most closely related to temperature
and precipitation at the surface, and to those products that would be easy to download and use.
FUTURE CLIMATE
Our knowledge of future climate conditions is based on experiments performed with climate
models (also known as atmosphere-ocean general circulation models). This section describes
how to judge and utilize the output from climate models in regional-scale vulnerability
assessments, and where to access climate model information.
TRANSLATING TO IMPACTS
Climate model output can be an integral component to a vulnerability assessment (and the
subsequent adaptation decisions). Outputs can provide information regarding how much or how
fast the climate could change. However, it is important to establish what types of information
climate models DO and DO NOT provide. This section will discuss emerging issues regarding
scenario selection, downscaling, and uncertainty in the context of regional-scale vulnerability
assessments.
What is a climate model?
A climate model is a mathematical representation of the climate system:
…climate models are used to simulate how…changes in GHG [greenhouse gas]
emissions and other climate forcing agents will translate into changes in the

Much of this data is available online. USGS Streamstats (http://water.usgs.gov/osw/streamstats/) has
historical streamflow data and statistics for various locations across the country Federal Emergency
Management Agency allows users to access maps of floodplains (referred to as Flood Insurance Rate Maps,
or FIRMs; http://www.fema.gov/hazard/map/firm.shtm), which have been developed using historical data;
NRCS has snowpack and soil moisture data across much of the western United States

climate system. Climate models are computer-based representations of the
atmosphere, oceans, cryosphere [ice and snow], land surface, and other
components of the climate system. All climate models are fundamentally based
on the laws of physics and chemistry that govern the motion and composition of
the atmosphere and oceans. (National Research Council, 2010; bracketed phrases
have been inserted)
The models’ simulations for the 21st century are called projections. These projections
are designed to help us understand how the addition of greenhouse gases to the
atmosphere might change our climate. Models are intended to be heuristic tools,
illuminating how many processes (e.g., the way in which oceans transport heat around the
planet; the strength and location of the jet streams) might respond to the addition of these
greenhouse gases, and the subsequent warming that occurs. Climate models are not
intended to be “prediction machines” that reveal the precise future conditions in a
particular location.
It is also important to note that climate models, by themselves, do not yield information
about the impacts of climate change. They simply provide simulations for future
temperature and precipitation, which can be converted into statistics (e.g., average
seasonal temperatures, annual return-frequency for days with temperatures above 100°F)
that can be compared to similar statistics representing the current climate.5 It is essential
that users understand the types of climate information that are most important to the
performance of their respective transportation networks. Performing a sensitivity
analysis (see “Value of Examining Historical Climate” section above) is a way to identify
the types of climate information (i.e., which measures of temperature and precipitation,
and on what time scale) that correspond to the quality and reliability of service, or to
damage and repair of assets.
Scenarios
Whenever a climate model is “run” into the future, a set of assumptions regarding the future
trajectory of the planet’s greenhouse gas emissions and other climate-forcing agents (e.g.,
aerosols) is used as inputs to the model. These assumptions chart a path forward for the world’s
population growth, economic growth, and rates of technological development and transfer of
technology. These assumptions, taken together, constitute an emissions scenario.6
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has developed a set of standard
emissions scenarios that are used in climate models. These scenarios are typically designated by
a set of letters and numbers (e.g., “A1B”, “B2”) that communicate information about the various
assumptions regarding future population, economic growth, and technological development that
relate

5

Technically speaking, the model projections should be compared to the model simulations for the 20th
century, and then the projected change should be compared to the observed statistics (e.g., those taken from
station data). For any model, especially at the regional-scale, the simulated 20th-century climate is likely to
differ slightly from the observed 20th-century climate –this is often referred to as bias. Focusing on the
projected change avoids incorporating the model’s bias into any interpretation of expected regional-scale
climate changes.
6
Notably, scenarios do not include any assumptions about policies designed to explicitly discourage
emissions of greenhouse gases.

to the scenarios’ respective emissions trajectories.7
It is important to note that the likelihood of occurrence of any scenario has not been assessed –
there are no probabilities assigned to the individual scenarios. The scenarios simply represent
possible future pathways. They do not necessarily “bracket” what future conditions could look
like, nor do they constitute what is most likely to occur.
Downscaling
Climate models render the Earth in a series of “pixels” or
grid boxes (Figure 5) that are several degrees of longitude
each side (roughly 60-200 miles, depending on the
geographic location and the particular model). Within each
grid box, calculations for meteorological variables are
performed, and the flows of mass and energy between grid
boxes are tracked.
The resolution of current climate models provides a coarse
view of the land surface. For example, details of coastlines
and mountain ranges that are smaller than the size of the grid
boxes are not directly incorporated into the model’s
calculations. Similarly, aspects of meteorology and climate
that occur on these relatively small spatial scales (e.g.,
structure of weather fronts, the evolution and properties of
clouds) are not always represented well.8

Figure 5: Illustration of a climate
model’s grid boxes. (Source:
climateprediction.net)

Downscaling techniques have emerged as a way to transform
the output from climate models to smaller spatial scales,
often to grid boxes that are a quarter or an eighth of a degree
of latitude and longitude on each side (between about 10-20 miles on a side). There are two
general methods of downscaling:

Statistical downscaling: Empirically-observed relationships between observed climate (at high
resolution) and modeled climate (at a coarse scale) are applied to future projections. These
relationships act as a “transfer function” that allow small-scale information to be added to the
patterns generated from the coarse-scale global climate model. Statistical downscaling
techniques are based on the assumption that historically observed relationships between largerscale climate patterns and the smaller-scale patterns (colloquially, these small-scale patterns are
sometimes referred to as microclimates) will not change as a result of climate change.

7

For the next round of IPCC model simulations (the Fifth Assessment, or AR5), new scenarios are being
developed. These scenarios, or Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs), will often involve similar
assumptions about future population growth and changing socio-economic conditions as the scenarios used
in previous Assessments. However, the RCPs have been developed with greater emphasis on greenhouse
gas concentrations, rather than emissions. Concentrations can be used more efficiently as inputs to
integrated assessment models that examine impacts. Also, the RCPs will include information about
possible mitigation policies, which was also lacking from the previous scenarios. For more information,
see the recent issue of Climatic Change, which is devoted to discussing various aspects of the RCPs
(http://www.springerlink.com/content/f296645337804p75/).

Sub-grid scale processes are represented using parameters that are based on empirically-derived
relationships, rather than direct calculations that are emerge from physical or chemical first principles.

10

Dynamic downscaling: The outputs from a coarse-scale, global climate model are used as inputs
for a climate model that operates in a smaller spatial domain (typically sub-continental). This
smaller-scale model works much like a global climate model – equations describing the physics
and chemistry of the atmosphere are solved in each of the grid boxes on the smaller domain, with
the solutions forced to be roughly consistent with the large-scale characteristics of climate that
have been simulated in the global model.
Statistical downscaling techniques are computationally less intensive than dynamic methods.
Although there are many algorithms for applying statistical downscaling, some of the more
popular methods (e.g., bias correction statistical downscaling, constructed analogs) often yield
results that are similar to one another.
The use of dynamic methods is an active area of research and the types of information that can be
gained by dynamic downscaling are still being established and debated. Given the computational
requirements, experiments using many combinations of global models and regional models are
time-consuming and expensive; hence, these investigations are likely to continue for the coming
years.
It is important to note that downscaling rarely improves the information about climate change that
is derived from the coarse-scale, global models. Although downscaling may reveal small-scale
patterns of interest (e.g., larger amounts of rainfall on windward slopes of mountains, relative to
nearby flatter terrain), the difference in the changes for the future may be less significant (e.g., the
change in precipitation for the mountainous areas and the flatter areas may be quite similar).
Similarly, downscaling the output from a suite of coarse-scale models will not necessarily result
in a tighter range of projections for a particular area.
Which models, scenarios, and spatial scales are right for you?
Unfortunately, the answer to this question in not simple or straightforward. A few important
points to keep in mind:




All models have some biases;
Scenarios outline potential futures, as opposed to likely or probable futures; and,
Downscaled model output is not necessarily more accurate or precise than the
information from the coarse-scale model.

Although there may not be a well established set of “best practices” for selecting models,
scenarios, and the spatial scale of future climate information, knowledge of the sensitivity of the
transportation system can be used to narrow some of these choices.





Since all models involve some bias, it is judicious to use a range of models. Ideally,
studies have been performed in your region to identify which models perform the best
when simulating features of the historical climate.
Typically, model differences have a larger impact than the scenarios on projected climate
changes through 2050. For 2100, the scenario differences are larger than the model
differences. Thus, if decisions between now and 2050 are of highest priority, it is less
important to examine a wide range of scenarios. If it is important to sample from a wide
range of temperature and precipitation changes, then a wide range of models should be
used. Conversely, for decisions with long time frames (greater than 40-50 years),
examining a range of scenarios is likely more important than a range of models.
Downscaled data can be extremely valuable as inputs to high-resolution models (e.g.,
hydrologic models) for aspects of the environment (e.g., river dynamics, coastal

11

Federal Highway Administration

processes) that affect transportation networks. However, the types of information that
they will “add” to the analysis should be established prior to expending significant time
or cost in performing the downscaling.
Projection of daily-scale extremes
Some of the most important impacts of weather and climate on transportation assets and services
occur during relatively short-lived events, including severe storms, floods, and heat waves.
However, model abilities to simulate the daily-scale statistics of climate in a particular region are
limited. Quantitative information derived from daily-scale statistics should be scrutinized and
used with care. For example, changes in the number of extremely hot days occurring in future
decades can span a wide range – projections for the end of the 21st century in parts of California
exhibit increases in the frequency of intense hot days occurring in a year ranging from a doubling
to increases by a factor of 8 or more. For heat waves lasting 5 days or more, the increases in
frequency cover an even wider range, with several models projecting 20- and 30-fold increases
(Cayan et al., 2009). Although all models and scenarios project a warmer future and an increase
in the frequency and intensity of heat waves across California, there is significant uncertainty as
to how this warming translates into daily-scale changes in weather at specific locations.
Similarly, for changes in precipitation, many models project a future with heavier downpours for
many regions in the U.S.; however, the magnitude of the changes can vary widely both across
scenarios, and even across models using the same scenario.9
Although there is no way to “eliminate” the uncertainty associated with projections of daily-scale
extremes, the mere fact that the model results involve uncertainty about the future does not need
to be a barrier to making useful conclusions about daily-scale extremes. Two potential
techniques include:
1) If it’s available, use data from many models and scenarios. For variables and regions
where many models agree about the direction and magnitude of change, more confident
conclusions can be made about the projected changes.
2) Identify impact thresholds from historical data, then apply the results of climate models
qualitatively. In other words, rather than trying to identify the quantitative change in the
frequency or intensity of heat waves or heavy precipitation at some future date, the goal
of the analysis can be altered to focus on more binary issues (i.e., yes/no issues; is the
event becoming more/less frequent?). Using heat waves as an example, if the impacts
from an historical heat wave of a certain magnitude or duration can be characterized, then
models could be used to conclude with high confidence that such events are likely to
become more frequent. If output from multiple models is available, conclusions can go
farther and involve some quantitative qualifiers such as “at least” (in reference to
projections from the most conservative/coldest models) or “in the range of.”

9

To clarify, this section is specific to understanding the statistics of daily-scale events as derived from
climate models. For seasonal and annual timescales, all model and scenario combinations project
increased temperatures for the United States and the globe (i.e. this is a robust finding of the models). For
seasonal and annual precipitation, some models and some scenarios project increases in precipitation, while
others project decreases. The results, and the consensus (or lack of a consensus) among models, are
dependent on the geographic region.

DATA SOURCES
A variety of research institutions across the world conduct model experiments, using high-end
computing resources. The output of these experiments are made available online (see Text Box
on Online Resources) for download.
One of the most commonly used sets of model experiments is the Coupled Model
Intercomparison Project (CMIP). The CMIP models act as a benchmark for climate research, and
form the core of the assessment of future climate in the IPCC reports. These models that are part
of CMIP meet a certain set of requirements regarding their technical specifications, their
performance, and the types of experiments to which they’ve been subjected.
Although it is possible to access the data from any of these climate models, manipulating the data
can be a challenge. The data formats (often Network Common Data Format, NetCDF) are not
easily read-able by typical desktop software (e.g., Excel) or Geographic Information System
(GIS) software packages. In addition, these data files are often extremely large and contain
information on a wide range of variables (e.g., temperature, wind speed and direction, heights of
pressure surfaces) for the entire globe. However, many of these variables would likely be
extraneous when conducting a vulnerability assessment for transportation assets in a specific
location.

TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE
For assistance in acquiring historical climate data, performing a sensitivity analysis, and acquiring
or making decisions about future climate information, there are many groups that can offer
potential assistance.
Some research institutions and non-profit organizations have begun to make downscaled climate
information available in more easy-to-use formats. Examples include the North American
Regional Climate Assessment Program and the Cal-Adapt project (see Text Box on Technical
Assistance). As these efforts become more widespread, and more examples of the use of these
data become available, the utility of these data portals is likely to grow.

APPENDIX
PILOT METHODOLOGIES FOR ESTIMATING THE IMPACTS OF SEA-LEVEL RISE
Since each of the FHWA pilot study areas included coastal areas, all of the pilots considered
vulnerability to sea-level rise to be a key climate change risk. Each of the pilots assessed this
vulnerability differently, but they experienced common challenges and faced similar types of
decisions. The purpose of this Appendix is to describe the pilots’ approaches and to detail the
relevant data sources, methodologies, challenges and barriers involved in conducting local-scale
vulnerability assessments of the impacts of sea-level rise.
BACKGROUND: ESTIMATING IMPACTS OF SEA-LEVEL RISE
INUNDATION MAPPING
Spatial analysis is a key part of assessing the vulnerability of assets to sea-level rise. Without
information on location and elevation, it is impossible to determine which assets will be exposed
to sea level rise, or for that matter storm surge and wave impacts associated with tropical storms
or other coastal storms. In order to characterize exposure, most studies of sea-level rise risk rely
on inundation mapping. This method uses a Geographic Information System (GIS) to map
inundated areas by analyzing areas of land that fall below increased water levels under different
scenarios of sea-level rise (also called the “bathtub model”).
As described in NOAA (2009), inundation mapping involves the following key steps:





Obtain and prepare elevation data and elevation surfaces for coastal land areas (includes
calibrating elevation to local tidal elevations);10
Determine projected sea-level rise and/or storm surge scenarios;
Use GIS to overlay the water surfaces onto the digital elevation map in order to identify
inundation areas; 11
Add other features of interest, produce final inundation maps.

CHALLENGES FOR LOCAL ANALYSES
The utility and accuracy of a sea-level rise assessment depends on the resolution of the
underlying elevation data. One standard source of elevation data, the USGS National Elevation
Dataset, supplies elevation data with a horizontal resolution of 30m and 10m for the entire United
States, which may be considered relatively coarse where coastlines are highly developed.
10

Calibration often involves the choice of a vertical datum. As defined by NOAA (2011), “A datum is a
base elevation used as a reference from which to reckon heights or depths. A tidal datum is a standard
elevation defined by a certain phase of the tide. Tidal datums are used as references to measure local water
levels.” Example tidal datums include mean higher high water and mean high water.
11
The sea-level rise projection must be chosen to account for the vertical accuracy of the elevation data for
the land (and vice versa). An accurate map requires the root mean square error of the elevation data to be
smaller than the projected change in sea-level rise (NOAA 2009). For more in-depth discussion of land
elevation data resolution and accuracy, see Chapter 2 of CCSP (2009).

Vertical resolution can vary, based on the source of the elevation data utilized by NED, but the
stated accuracy of available data from the NED is around +/-2.4m. However, since global
projected sea-level rise changes only reach 2m by the end of the 21st century (if at all), maps
based on the NED will generally not provide accurate predictions of exposure of specific assets.
In order to obtain more useful elevation information, local assessments will likely need to rely on
digital elevation models derived from high resolution LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging)
data. These data are not available in all locations. In addition, projects must ensure that the
LiDAR data have been properly processed, including adjustments to the vertical datum12 before
use.
In addition to the horizontal and vertical resolution requirements for elevation data, there are
other challenges for analyzing sea-level rise vulnerability at a local scale. As described in CCSP
(2009), inundation mapping can be misleading because elevation is not the only determinant of
coastal vulnerability. Mapping may not take into account the uplift or subsidence of the land
surface. In areas where land is sinking, the apparent rate of sea-level rise (often referred to as the
“local” or “relative” rate of sea-level rise) will be greater than the rate associated with changes in
the global mean sea level.
Sea-level rise will likely occur slowly over a period of time and will manifest differently in
different areas due to ongoing coastal processes, such as changes in tidal flow and sediment
volume. In some places, land will become permanently flooded, while in other areas it will erode.
Barrier islands and wetlands may migrate or disappear, and storms, waves, and currents will
continually modify the landscape as the sea-level rises. Although the simple bath tub approach
may indicate the relative risk among areas, it may not serve as a “prediction” for how the future
landscape will appear. Typically, such limitations are not critical for identifying areas at risk at
broad spatial scales (e.g., regionally or nationally) or communicating these risks to the general
public. However, they may be important to keep in mind when such maps are used for local land
use planning.

12

Adjustments to the vertical datum are a necessary part of mapping inundation. The land elevation data
are usually referenced to a vertical datum called the North American Vertical Datum of 1988 (NAVD88).
This datum is not tidal, meaning that a value of 0 does not equate to any particular local tide value.
Correcting this issue requires converting the elevation data from NAVD88 to a tidal datum, such as mean
high tide (NOAA, 2011).

DETAILS OF PILOT APPROACHES
Each of the FHWA pilot studies accounted for sea-level rise vulnerability differently. The
following sections attempt to outline some of the key aspects of their respective technical choices
regarding data sets and methods, as well as the goals and partnerships involved in their
assessments.
Specifically, we’ve tried to capture the following decisions made by the pilots:


How will sea-level rise vulnerability information be used (e.g. for public education,
internal communication, community planning, project level planning)?
The intended purpose of the map should shape the inundation mapping approach. For

18



example, a map intended to inform community or project planning purposes will likely
require elevation data at a higher resolution than a map intended to educate the public or
communicate overall sea-level rise risk to the region.
What estimates of sea-level rise are used? Why or how were these chosen?
Many of the studies relied on estimates adopted by state or regional planning
organizations, or those appearing in published literature.
What was the source of the elevation data?
The source of the data is typically related to both the purpose of the project and the
availability of data sets for a particular region or locality.
To what extent should other factors, such as land subsidence or shore protection, be
taken into consideration?
Similar to the elevation data, these considerations are often tied to the purpose of the
project and the availability of appropriate data sets.

NEW JERSEY
Since sea-level rise is a very important impact to the New Jersey coastal study area, the pilot
conducted its own inundation mapping.








Elevation data: The pilot was able to obtain very high resolution LiDAR data that had not
yet been publically released by USGS. They then processed these LiDAR points into
digital elevation models.
Sea-level rise scenarios: One of the partners in the New Jersey pilot was the Department
of Environmental Protection (DEP). The pilot worked closely with the DEP to ensure that
all sea-level rise scenarios and projects matched the assumptions of the DEP. Since the
DEP had already decided to use 0.5m, 1.0m, and 1.5m 2100 projections for global sealevel rise, the New Jersey pilot began with these estimates.
Adjustment to local sea-level rise: The pilot calibrated these global sea-level rise
projections to the study area by adjusting based on local subsidence data. To localize the
data further, New Jersey also took salinity, temperature, and other factors into
consideration.
Storm surge modeling: The New Jersey pilot chose to use the SLOSH (Sea, Lake, and
Overland Surges from Hurricanes; http://slosh.nws.noaa.gov/sloshPub/) model in order to
consider the impacts of storm surge.13 The pilot felt it would be advantageous to examine
a range of potential storm paths, which SLOSH does well.14

13

SLOSH (Sea, Lake and Overland Surges from Hurricanes) is a computerized model run by the National
Hurricane Center (NHC) to estimate storm surge heights and winds resulting from historical, hypothetical,
or predicted hurricanes. (http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/HAW2/english/surge/slosh.shtml)
14
This memorandum was originally written prior to Hurricane Irene (August 20-29, 2011). Some of the
impacts of Irene are discussed in the New Jersey team’s final report.

OAHU MPO
The Oahu MPO pilot worked closely with Dr. Chip Fletcher and his lab at the University of
Hawaii to develop high resolution inundation maps of the study area.










Elevation data: Dr. Fletcher and his team compared two LiDAR datasets, one from the
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the other from NOAA. These data were calibrated
against the Kahului tide station.
Sea-level rise scenarios: Dr. Fletcher considered two sea-level rise scenarios, 0.75m and
1.9m. These scenarios are for global sea-level rise and are based on Vermeer and
Rahmstorf (2009).
Mapping inundation: The pilot used a ‘bathtub’ approach to identify areas of land which
are lower in elevation than each of the sea-level rise scenarios based on the LiDAR
digital elevation data.
Challenges with the vertical datum: During the course of this study, Dr. Fletcher and his
lab found that there is no established vertical datum for Hawaii. This data gap affects the
accuracy of the digital elevation models.
Overlays with asset data: Once he had established the inundation area, Dr. Fletcher
analyzed the total land area, length of roads, land and building value, number of Census
2010 blocks, and number of land parcels vulnerable to each sea-level rise scenario.

There are several additional pieces of information that the Oahu MPO would like to explore,
including:




Response of the water table to sea-level rise,
Improving the understanding of current impacts associated with flooding, wave
overwash, erosion, and coastal rock fall, and
Commuter volumes in vulnerable areas.

Oahu MPO has engaged regional transportation planners and other stakeholders regarding sealevel rise. During the MPO’s workshop with stakeholders, the Oahu MPO pilot used “what if”
scenarios to help participants think through consequences of climate change, including scenarios
of sea-level rise.
SAN FRANCISCO
The purpose of the San Francisco pilot sea-level rise mapping was to inform community and
project level planning. Therefore, the pilot’s inundation maps are based on very high resolution
elevation data and account for local factors such as shoreline protection, inundation depth and
extent, wind and wave effects, and hydrologic continuity. The pilot worked closely with Noah
Knowles and updated the methodology in Knowles (2009) with new LiDAR data.


Elevation data: The pilot combined five different sources of high resolution elevation
data in order to create a digital elevation model (see Knowles 2009 for additional
information on data sources).

20







Sea-level rise scenarios: The pilot assumed 16 inches of global sea-level rise in midcentury and 55 inches at the end of the century. These scenarios are based on the amount
of global sea-level rise projected based on CCSM3 global climate model temperature
outputs under an A2 greenhouse gas emissions scenario. For each time period, the pilot
analyzed both the still water and the 100 year return high tide level with wind and wave
effects.
Inundation modeling: In order to quantify the high water levels in the Bay accurately, the
pilot used a hydrodynamic model of the San Francisco Bay estuary, based on the
methodology described in Knowles (2009).
Weak link analysis: The pilot conducted a weak link analysis to assess inundation depth
in order to determine the thresholds at which different share protection barriers would
fail.

VIRGINIA DOT/HAMPTON ROADS
The goal of the Virginia DOT/Hampton Roads inundation and storm surge work was to generate
realistic scenarios that could be used as inputs into the pilot’s multi-criteria decision analysis
framework. The Hampton Roads region is highly vulnerable to sea-level rise partially because the
area is already subsiding due to geological processes and groundwater withdrawals (HRPDC
2011). One of the main goals of the Virginia pilot was to construct and assess the influence of
climate-change scenarios (primarily sea-level rise and storm surge) to the strategic priorities of
long-range transportation plans. The pilot relied on sea-level rise and storm surge data from an
ongoing Hampton Roads Planning District Commission study.
To get a sense of sea-level rise exposure, HRPDC analyzed historical sea-level rise trends,
including subsidence of the land surface, and found that the regional average is 1-2 feet of sealevel rise over the past 100 years. The project assumed that the historical rate of sea-level rise will
continue in the future, while recognizing the importance of monitoring trends and adjusting for
any acceleration in sea-level rise.
The Hampton Roads Planning District Commission (HRPDC) is currently in its second year of a
climate change adaptation project that focuses on sea-level rise and storm surge.






Elevation data: The project used elevation data of varying resolution. While several
localities had already developed their own detailed elevation data, the remainder used the
USGS topographic data from the National Elevation Dataset (NED).
Storm surge modeling: In order to identify specific areas and assets of Hampton Roads
that are at risk from sea-level rise, the project relied on the Virginia Hurricane Evacuation
Study, a cooperative effort involving the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the Federal
Emergency Management Agency, and other state and local agencies. This analysis used
the SLOSH model to determine the maximum tide elevations from a set of storms of
differing magnitude. Using GIS, the Virginia Hurricane Evacuation Study applied these
tide elevations to local elevation data in order to create flood hazard areas.
Sea-level rise: Since not all of the areas had high resolution elevation data, HRPDC is
assuming that the storm surge zones are also the areas exposed to sea-level rise (HRPDC

21

Federal Highway Administration

2011). The project is planning future analyses which will further distinguish sea-level rise
impacts from storm surge impacts (HRPDC 2011).
WASHINGTON STATE DOT
The Washington State DOT worked closely with the Climate Impacts Group at the University of
Washington to develop LiDAR-based inundation maps of the study area. During the pilot’s
workshops to identify vulnerable assets, workshop participants “ground-truthed” the maps by
pointing out missing assets, areas already being impacted, or other factors that should be
considered in the vulnerability assessment. The pilot anticipates that these maps will also serve as
communication tools to educate influential decisionmakers in Washington State.




Elevation data: The Washington DOT pilot used LiDAR data for the Puget Sound from
different sources along with tide gauge data going back at least 70 years.
Sea-level rise scenarios: The pilot adopted the sea-level rise estimates that are used by
the Puget Sound Regional Council (2 feet and 4 feet).
Much of the analysis from the Washington State Climate Assessment
(http://cses.washington.edu/cig/res/ia/waccia.shtml) was also incorporated in the sealevel rise considerations.

FHWA’s Climate Change and Extreme Weather Vulnerability
Assessment Framework
Executive Summary
The Federal Highway Administration’s (FHWA’s) Climate Change and Extreme Weather Vulnerability
Assessment Framework is a guide for transportation agencies interested in assessing their vulnerability
to climate change and extreme weather events. It gives an overview of key steps in conducting
vulnerability assessments and uses in-practice examples to demonstrate a variety of ways to gather and
process information. The framework is comprised of three key steps: defining study objectives and
scope; assessing vulnerability; and incorporating results into decision making.
Defining the objectives and scope of the study at the beginning of the process is important because it
creates boundaries for the analysis and can limit extraneous data collection efforts. To define study
scope, agencies should first consider their overall goals and objectives. Objectives for a vulnerability
assessment may include siting new assets in areas less vulnerable to climate change, educating staff
regarding overall climate risks to the agency’s transportation system, or informing the development of
adaptation strategies. Based on these objectives, an agency can then select and characterize relevant
assets and identify climate variables for study. The initial objectives and scope may be altered by the
other steps in the process as new information is gathered or limitations are better understood.
Climate change and extreme weather vulnerability in the transportation context are a function of a
transportation asset or system’s sensitivity to climate effects, exposure to climate effects, and adaptive
capacity. Tasks in the vulnerability assessment include: gathering and integrating data and information
on asset location, characteristics, and climate sensitivities; gathering and obtaining information on
historical weather events and projected climate; combining the asset and climate information to identify
vulnerabilities; and potentially, assigning a level of risk of the climate impacts on the assets. The
vulnerability assessment work is an iterative process; information gathered on assets may inform
climate information needs and vice versa.
Incorporating the results of the vulnerability assessment into the agency’s decision-making process
ensures that the study results are used in practice. An agency may be able to use the results of the
assessment in its asset management programs, hazard mitigation plans, transportation planning project
selection criteria, or other programs and processes. In addition, a transportation agency might be
interested in using the results of the analysis to inform the development of specific adaptation
strategies for assets identified as highly vulnerable to climate change.

Draft FHWA Climate Change and Extreme Weather Vulnerability Assessment Framework

1 Introduction
The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA’s) Climate Change and Extreme Weather Vulnerability
Assessment Framework (hereafter, “the framework”) is a guide and collection of resources for use in
analyzing the impacts of climate change and extreme weather on transportation infrastructure. Its
purpose is to identify key considerations, questions, and resources that can be used to design and
implement a climate change vulnerability assessment. The processes, lessons learned, and resources
outlined in the framework are geared toward State departments of transportation (DOTs), metropolitan
planning organizations (MPOs), and other agencies involved in planning, building, or maintaining the
transportation system. It includes suggestions and examples applicable to a wide range of applications,
from small qualitative studies to large, detailed, data-intensive analyses. The resources included in the
framework will be added to and updated over time.
The framework is informed by and draws examples from
five climate change vulnerability and risk assessment
pilot projects that the FHWA sponsored in 2010-2011
(hereafter, “the 2010 pilots”). The 2010 pilots were
undertaken by State DOTs and MPOs to implement an
earlier version of the framework, which the FHWA
termed the “Vulnerability and Risk Assessment
Conceptual Model.” The conceptual model was meant to
serve as a flexible guide for the 2010 pilots to test these
basic steps and for the FHWA to obtain feedback on the
suggested process. This updated framework uses the
experiences of the pilots to provide some examples of
the “how to” of the assessment. The 2010 pilots were:

Climate change vulnerability in the
transportation context is a function of a
transportation system’s exposure to climate
effects, sensitivity to climate effects, and
adaptive capacity.
Exposure refers to whether the asset or
system is located in an area experiencing
direct impacts of climate change, such as
temperature and precipitation changes, or
indirect impacts, such as sea level rise.
Sensitivity refers to how the asset or system
fares when exposed to an impact.

2 Defining Objectives and Scope
This section provides suggestions and resources for articulating objectives, selecting and characterizing
relevant assets, and identifying climate variables for study. Together, these steps frame the scope of the
vulnerability assessment and drive the details required for the analysis. They form bounds to the study,
minimizing data collection and analysis activities that would ultimately be extraneous to study
objectives.
While we recommend articulating the objectives of the assessment as a first step, agencies may find it
useful to simultaneously work to characterize relevant assets and identify climate variables to study.

Formulating Study Teams
Deciding who will be involved in the study has a large impact on how the study is run and the final
outcomes. The members of the study team will for the most part be dictated by the study objectives.
Often, a cross-disciplinary team is needed to integrate long-range planning, engineering, and asset
management considerations into the vulnerability assessment effectively. For instance, each of the
following disciplines may have something to offer for the study:
• Transportation planners are responsible for long-range planning of the transportation system,
and regularly work with scenario planning and other tools for planning long-term investments
and policies in the face of uncertain futures.
• GIS specialists can provide invaluable expertise in both analyzing and displaying transportation
assets and vulnerability information.
• Asset managers may have valuable datasets and are familiar with the conditions of assets.
• State climatologists can provide information and insight into historical climate data and trends,
and in some cases future projections.
• NOAA and University climate change research centers can provide projections targeted to your
study area.
• Maintenance personnel often have the best on-the-ground familiarity with the ways weather
events affect transportation assets today, and what it takes to maintain the system in the face
of these impacts.
• Design engineers (e.g., structural, hydraulic, coastal, or other relevant disciplines) can provide
input into the sensitivity of infrastructure to climate impacts and ideas/costs for adaptation
solutions.
• Natural resource agency personnel can provide insight into trends in the natural environment
and understanding of how projected changes might impact ecosystem services.

2.1 Articulating Objectives
It is important to identify goals and objectives early in the vulnerability assessment process as they help
determine the level of detail required in the analysis and the data and products that might be needed.
When developing the objectives, consider the intended outcomes and target audiences. Objectives can
be based on a range of activities or goals. Some questions to consider:

What actions might be motivated by the assessment?
Who is your target audience?
What products are needed?
How will they be used?
What level of detail is required?
Example objectives include:
• Understanding the vulnerability of an agency’s overall transportation system to climate change
on a very general level.
• Informing the development and implementation of effective adaptation strategies.
• Integrating the vulnerability assessment into existing agency decision making processes.
• Planning for the siting or construction of new assets or services.
• Prioritizing among potential improvements or retrofits to existing assets.
• Implementing operational or design changes to mitigate climate vulnerabilities.
• Determining potential consequences from a particular type of climate impact, such as sea-level
rise.
• Identifying segments or facilities at risk to climate change impacts.
• Understanding the scale and cost of climate impacts.
• Developing or augmenting data collection efforts about assets.
• Establishing or improving geo-spatial tools that can be used for transportation planning.
• Engaging stakeholders within the community or across other agencies.
• Educating transportation staff about potential risks posed by climate variability and climate
change.
• Raising awareness among the public about activities to manage climate risks or efforts to bolster
sustainability.
2.1.1. Examples from Practice: Articulating Objectives
Objectives deeply influence the scope and methodology of assessments. For example:
•

Page 4

The San Francisco pilot team’s vulnerability assessment work was a part of the “Adapting to
Rising Tides” (ART) project (www.adaptingtorisingtides.org), which is designed to increase the
Bay Area’s preparedness and resilience to sea level rise and storm events while protecting
critical ecosystem and community services. The purpose of the project was to help the region’s
transportation and conservation planners improve vulnerability and risk assessment practices
and to help formulate effective adaptation strategies. A goal of the project was to develop an
approach for fostering local agency support and input on climate vulnerability and risk
assessments. As such, the study team limited the study area for this initial effort a portion of
one county, and limited the project scope to analyzing the impacts of sea-level rise and storm
events. Many of the analysis steps involved efforts to engage stakeholders, consistent with the
Climate Change & Extreme Weather Vulnerability Assessment

Draft FHWA Climate Change and Extreme Weather Vulnerability Assessment Framework
overall emphasis of the ART project on a collaborative planning process. The team developed
detailed risk and vulnerability summaries for the most vulnerable ground transportation assets
in order to inform the development of future adaptation strategies.
•

The New Jersey pilot team’s work represented a first step in a climate assessment for the
various team members. Their project was designed to address a broad range of climate-related
concerns. Their work is intended to be a platform for further assessment for other areas of
New Jersey and their results will be used to engage a variety of transportation planners working
at local, State, and regional levels. It included the compilation of a relatively comprehensive
inventory of assets within two designated study regions, as well as the collection and analysis of
a range of climate variables for the impacts analysis. The pilot team also helped to strengthen
the partnerships among the agencies represented.

•

The Gulf Coast Phase 2 study, which is being conducted by U.S. Department of Transportation
(USDOT) in cooperation with the South Alabama Regional Planning Commission (SARPC),
focuses on assessing vulnerability of Mobile, AL and developing analysis methods that can be
replicated by other areas. The project also has a goal of enhancing regional decision makers'
ability to understand potential impacts on specific critical components of infrastructure and to
evaluate adaptation options. To this end, the study team has for the most part limited the
project scope to methods and datasets that would typically be available in other study areas
(with the exception of the climate information). The study team established a stakeholder
group of local decision makers with which they regularly coordinate and narrowed the scope of
assets for detailed study to those most important to the region.

•

The Virginia Pilot study was led by researchers from the University of Virginia. The study team
was interested in developing a decision support model that could be used by multiple areas,
using Hampton Roads as a case study. They worked with the Hampton Roads Planning District
Commission to test the model for real-world application. They have made their model available
on a Web site at: http://www.virginia.edu/crmes/fhwa_climate/.

2.2 Selecting and Characterizing Relevant Assets
Transportation agencies need to decide which assets they wish to evaluate to meet the objectives of
their assessment. Identifying the relevant assets for a vulnerability study and determining which
characteristics of these assets to examine can help agencies narrow the scope of the vulnerability study.
For example, if an agency would like to focus on a certain set of assets (e.g., owned or planned assets) it
would begin the process by deciding which assets to include, assessing data availability for those assets,
and understanding the timeframe and other important characteristics of managing those assets. When
compiling this inventory, agencies should also gather any information that may help later to evaluate
how resilient the asset is to climate stressors, and how costly damage to the asset or reductions in
service could be. Example information types are provided below.
2.2.1

Asset Type

A wide range of asset types and system services could be considered in the assessment, depending on
an agency’s objectives. Transportation infrastructure such as roads, rails, and bridges will be a major
focus for most agencies, but assets can also include support facilities, vehicles, and even ecosystem
related assets for agencies interested in understanding how climate change will affect their

environmental commitments or the ecosystem services on which the agency may rely. Some of the
assets and systems that might be considered include:

Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS)
Signs and other roadside assets
Pipelines and energy corridors
Storm water management facilities
Wetlands
Floodplains
Roadside vegetation
Areas of potential rock fall
Temporal Scope

The study goals and audience may drive the temporal scope of the assets being assessed for
vulnerability. If the target audience includes maintenance staff, then the study might focus on seasonal
effects to existing assets. Alternatively, if the goal of the assessment is to help a metropolitan planning
organization consider climate change effects in their long-term planning efforts, then it may be useful to
include the future, planned assets that are in the long-range transportation plan in the universe of
assets reviewed for vulnerability. In general, if the audience for the study is concerned about assets
with long design lives (and planned upgrades) or assets envisioned for the future, it is important to
include these assets in the analysis. For instance, the goal of the study may be to provide input to
capital and rehabilitation cycles, so that new assets and upgraded assets incorporate needed
adaptations.
2.2.3

Asset Data availability

Data availability can be a limiting factor on the inclusion of assets in the study scope. A variety of data is
needed for climate vulnerability assessments, only some of which may be easily gleaned from standard
agency databases. In some cases, necessary data may be in multiple databases or in different formats
and may require significant effort to merge the information into a usable format. Typical data that might
be needed for a vulnerability assessment includes:

Further Delineating Assets

In most cases, time and resource constraints prevent analyzing every asset in a transportation system.
An important part of scoping the study, therefore, is finding a way to delineate which assets to examine.
A number of different approaches have been used:
 Jurisdictional. Agencies may choose to limit the assessment to assets that are within their control
(e.g., State-owned facilities for a State DOT analysis). Though less comprehensive, this can more
directly inform future actions by the agency.
 Geographic. Specific areas may be more vulnerable to some climate effects. For instance, low
lying areas are more vulnerable to flooding from sea-level rise or river flooding. Agencies might
focus on these areas to quickly limit the analysis to the assets most likely to be affected by climate
changes.
 Representative. An agency interested in understanding the range of impacts that might affect its
system could select a small number of assets that represent the different types of infrastructure and
assets found in its system.
 Historically poor performing or old infrastructure. Assets that are subject to frequent flooding
and debris problems or old infrastructure with little design life left may be most vulnerable to the
additional stressors imposed by climate changes.
 Most critical. Another approach is to identify the most critical elements of the transportation
system for analysis, using quantitative or qualitative criteria. This provides a structured way to focus
on the assets that are most important for the functioning of the transportation system. For instance,
this approach might be taken if the objective of the vulnerability assessment is to understand the
potential impact of climate change on the evacuation routes within a region. However, sometimes
defining the most “critical” assets in a system can become politicized, as stakeholders may feel that
their interests are not given sufficient priority. [See Section 2.3 for more information on conducting
a criticality assessment.]
2.2.5

Examples from Practice: Selecting and Characterizing Relevant Assets

The pilot teams chose different ways of defining the scope of the assets to include. Many of these
choices were related to the objectives of the overall analysis. In addition, these choices often reflected
the jurisdictional boundaries of the agencies involved in the assessment or limits of the resources
available. For example:
Climate Change & Extreme Weather Vulnerability Assessment

Page 7

•

The WSDOT Pilot team focused on transportation infrastructure that it owned, which included roads,
rails, ferry terminals, and airports. They included assets already in place and funded projects (permitted
and in final design), as opposed to proposed projects in transportation plans.

•

The Virginia Pilot team performed analyses along four different dimensions of transportation planning,
focusing on: existing assets, projects within the existing Long Range Transportation Plan, transportation
analysis zones, and transportation policies.

•

The San Francisco pilot team began with a list of almost 150 assets. These were narrowed down by
combining assets (for example, including local streets with bike lanes and bus routes instead of looking
at all three networks separately), eliminating assets that would not experience sea level rise under any
of the anticipated scenarios, and ultimately focusing on representative and unique assets in the study
area. These assets were evaluated to determine their specific risk and vulnerability, as well as, the risk
and vulnerability of the system the asset was from. The team cited three reasons for deciding to use a
set of representative and unique assets rather than a set of identified critical assets:
o Most assets in the small study area were arguably important.
o Determining importance would require data and detail beyond the budget and schedule of the
project, and there was not enough background information on some of the facilities to perform an
assessment of criticality.
o They did not want to pass over assets that may not be “critical” but have intrinsic value to the
region (such as recreational, commute or goods movement value).

•

The New Jersey Pilot team conducted a detailed analysis using the statewide travel demand model to
identify the zones with the greatest travel activity, and used that as a basis for determining critical
corridors and assets throughout the study area.

•

The Oahu MPO Pilot team used stakeholder input in a multi-day workshop to identify the areas and
types of infrastructure that were considered high priority, and develop a list of five assets to focus on in
subsequent analysis. The Pilot team identified several advantages of the stakeholder workshop
method of identifying assets:
o It accomplished multiple objectives in a short timeframe.
o It helped accomplish the task with limited financial resources. Additionally, the pilot team was able
to count the attendance of many workshop participants as in-kind match for Federal funding
requirements.
o It served as a method for technology transfer within the State of Hawaii and to other Pacific island
nations.

•

The Gulf Coast Phase 2 Study boundaries were limited to the Mobile, AL metropolitan area, a
significantly smaller study area than phase one of the study. The smaller study area allowed for a more
detailed analysis. The study focused on critical assets for each of six modes: highways, transit, rail,
airports, ports, and land-based pipelines.

challenges, and draws on examples from the FHWA Adaptation Conceptual Model Pilots and the ongoing
USDOT Gulf Coast Phase 2 study.

2.3 Assessing Asset Criticality
Performing a criticality assessment is one way to narrow assets for further study. It provides a
structured way to identify the most important assets that an agency might wish to examine for
vulnerability to climate change. Although useful, criticality assessments can be resource and data
intensive. There are several approaches available for asset prioritization, falling into two broad
categories (these general approaches can also be used to prioritize assets for reasons other than
criticality):

Desk Review. One approach to formulating criticality criteria is to identify a broad range of
criteria that capture use and access across a range of modes and systems. Assets are ranked
based on data such as average daily traffic, functional classification, goods movement,
emergency management, and expert judgment. Advantages of the approach include its
transparency and replicability. However, lack of data on important elements of criticality, many
of which are qualitative and locally specific, or not available from the private sector, could
undermine results of the desk review in the eyes of the local stakeholders and decision makers.
Moreover, the results are dependent on the weight applied to the various criteria; again, this
weighting may not adequately capture local concerns.
Stakeholder Input. Determining asset criticality based on input from select stakeholders and

local experts is a second approach to assessing criticality. With a stakeholder input approach,
the project leaders will identify a group of stakeholders in the region with expert knowledge of
specific interests (e.g., commercial activity, public safety, or road maintenance). The project
leaders will then elicit feedback from these stakeholders on which assets are critical.
Advantages of the stakeholder approach include getting buy-in from relevant stakeholders early
in the process, encouraging collaboration and communication among stakeholders and actors
likely to implement any adaptation strategies, accessing information that is not readily available
in publicly-available datasets, and quickly assessing criticality without a lengthy research
process. However, the results of the stakeholder -driven process are highly subjective, and the
outcomes are dependent on the quality of the stakeholder engagement. For example, if project
leaders decide to hold a workshop or series of workshops to solicit stakeholder feedback, the
quality of the workshop facilitation, composition of workshop attendees, and level of
participation from key experts will be important factors in the ultimate success of the
stakeholder input approach.
Often, the two approaches are combined. Typically, a desk review will identify an initial list of critical
assets based on commonly available data such as average daily traffic or economic information for the
region (e.g., data on imports/exports from a particular port). The project team will then use the results
of the desk review to inform and structure feedback from stakeholders and local experts.
2.3.1
•

Examples from Practice: Assessing Criticality
The New Jersey pilot used the desk review approach. They developed a GIS based tool to
conduct a “destination-based” criticality assessment, considering jobs, population density,

Climate Change & Extreme Weather Vulnerability Assessment

Page 9

average annual daily traffic, and ridership data. They note that their GIS criticality assessment
tool “provides agencies with a robust platform to support smart decision-making, but it is not
intended to substitute for the judgment and discretion of agency officials.”
•

The Oahu MPO pilot used the stakeholder input approach. They held a two-day multidisciplinary workshop to identify five critical assets for further study.

•

The WSDOT pilot also used the stakeholder input approach. In workshops around the State,
WSDOT employees with local knowledge rated facilities for criticality on a ten-point scale. Note
that while they developed criticality ratings, the WSDOT study assessed the climate vulnerability
of all assets, not just those identified as critical. [See Figure 2]

Notice that along with the qualitative terms there is an associated scale of 1 to 10, this is
to serve as a facilitation tool for some people who may find it useful to think in terms of a
numerical scale – although the scoring by each individual is of course subjective. The scale
is a generic scale of criticality where “1” is very low (least critical) and “10” is very critical.

The Gulf Coast 2 project used a combined desk review and stakeholder input. A matrix of
socioeconomic, operational, and health and safety characteristics of each potential asset was
developed to “score” each asset for criticality. The scoring was done through a combination of
quantitative measures and qualitative best judgment. A redundancy analysis was performed
using the regional travel demand model to test the effect that losing particular links in the
network had on congestion. The list of assets developed from this scoring system was
supplemented with input from the study stakeholder group. The involvement of the stakeholder
group was essential, since one of the lessons learned was that the “desk review” did not capture
all the assets regarded as critical by local stakeholders. For instance, stakeholder input led to the
inclusion of the Bayou La Batre port, home to a fishing and shrimping fleet with seafood
processing facilities deemed important to the Mobile economy.

approaches for narrowing the universe of transportation assets to study in a climate change
vulnerability and risk assessment by assessing their "criticality" and otherwise narrowing study scope. It
identifies common challenges, and draws on examples from the FHWA Adaptation Conceptual Model
Pilots and the ongoing USDOT Gulf Coast Phase 2 study.
Assessing Infrastructure for Criticality in Mobile, AL: Final Technical Memo, FHWA, 2011. This memo
summarizes the methodology and findings of Task 1 of the Gulf Coast Phase 2 study, which identified
the transportation infrastructure components most critical to the Mobile region.

2.4 Identify Key Climate Variables to Study
An important first step to a vulnerability assessment is identifying which climate variables should be
included in the study. Not all changes to the future climate will be significant to the local or regional
transportation network, and limiting the study to the key variables of interest may allow for more indepth projections of these variables. Section 3.3 includes more detailed information on developing
climate information.
2.4.1

Key climate variables to consider

A range of future changes to the climate are of importance to transportation systems. Which ones are
important to a specific transportation agency will vary by region and by study objectives. For
transportation, the most important changes are often not changes to annual or seasonal averages, but
to relatively short duration extreme events that can cause significant damage to transportation
infrastructure or disrupt transportation operations. Examples of the kinds of climate changes included in
transportation vulnerability assessments are broadly outlined below:
 Temperature. Temperature is projected to increase in almost every part of the country in the
coming decades. For transportation, some impacts of interest might include increases in the number
of very hot days, heat waves, changes to freeze-thaw cycles, and changes to the length of the
construction season.
 Extreme Precipitation Events. Parts of the United States are projected to get wetter in the future
while others will get dryer. However, many of the most significant transportation impacts will likely
come from extreme precipitation events, which are projected to intensify. This poses flooding risks
to roads, rails, maintenance facilities, and other assets, with below grade infrastructure such as
tunnels, and poorly drained facilities being particularly vulnerable. Some areas will experience cycles
of extended drought followed by extreme precipitation events which may destabilize vegetation
along hillsides and increase the likelihood of rockfall.
 Sea-Level and Coastal Storm Surge. Sea-level is already rising along the U.S. coastlines, and the
rate of sea-level rise is projected to accelerate over the coming century. This presents the risk of
permanent or periodic inundation of coastal infrastructure as well as increased coastal erosion,
rising groundwater levels and changes in salinity and it poses additional risks during storms by

Climate Change & Extreme Weather Vulnerability Assessment

Page 11

increasing storm surge heights as compared to today. In addition, coastal storms may intensify in
the future, further increasing storm surge levels.
 Permafrost Thaw. In Alaska, much transportation infrastructure is built on permafrost
foundations. Warming temperatures in the Arctic are already causing damage by thawing
permafrost.
 Snowmelt Hydrology. Changes in winter snow accumulation, the timing and rate of spring
snowmelt, and changes from a snow dominant to a rain dominant regime can cause an imbalance in
the sediment transport characteristics of rivers, leading to flooding and channel instability problems
for transportation infrastructure that is built alongside or crosses rivers.
2.4.2

Selecting climate variables to study

The climate variables selected will most likely be influenced by agencies’ experiences regarding the
system’s performance in the past in response to the local weather, especially during extreme weather
conditions such as high winds, heat waves, flooding caused by heavy precipitation or coastal storms, or
drought. Examining transportation system performance during historic weather events can aid in
understanding the sensitivity of the transportation system to weather extremes and aid in selection of
the climate variables and thresholds to examine in the projections, providing information that can be
used to gauge impacts associated with future climate conditions.
An assessment of past weather-related disruption and damage may consider:
•
•
•
•
•

Weather related sources of disruption to transportation services.
Transportation assets currently affected by weather extremes.
Damage to roads or bridges, or supporting infrastructure (e.g., culverts).
Thresholds at which the system begins to experience impacts (e.g., a specific high temperature
or a peak flow rate that has led to damage or failure).
Locations within the system that experience impacts.

The historical information can provide a foundation from which to identify future vulnerabilities and the
climate variables/thresholds that should be addressed in the projections. For example, if heat waves
pose problems for transportation systems or assets, then the model projections for temperature during
the spring, summer, and fall months should be investigated closely (increases in winter temperatures
are unlikely to result in “heat waves” for most locations). A specific variable to consider might be the
frequency of days over 95 degrees Fahrenheit in the future, which might affect restrictions on
construction or operations work crews, or perhaps information on likely exceedances of the
temperature threshold applied in a particular materials specification or guidance.
While these thresholds should inform the variables for which projections are run, it is also important to
be mindful of the potential of climate effects previously experienced rarely, if at all. For instance, in
coastal areas it may make sense to consider projections of sea-level rise even if sea levels or tides have
not been a concern in the past. [See section 3.4 for additional discussion of climate sensitivity.]

2.4.3

Options for Obtaining Climate Information

One consideration in determining what climate variables to look at may be the availability of future
climate data for your study area, given the resources at your disposal. Information on projected
changes in climate can be obtained in several different ways, including:
•

Refer to existing climate information developed by others, like the Unites States Global Change
Research Program (USGCRP),that is relevant at broad geographical scales, as noted above.
Preliminary questions on potential impacts may be answered by referring to broader regional
reports on changes in climate.

•

Use climate data that has already been downscaled to your area for other studies. Some States
and metropolitan areas have developed downscaled climate data for State or city climate action
plans. These data can then be used for a more detailed transportation analysis.

•

Work with climate modelers to develop projections tailored to your needs. This can be a
resource intensive approach, but can be used to generate detailed information for your analysis.
(This approach is discussed further in the Analysis section below.)

•

Use information that is being used for other studies in your State or region in order to be
consistent and reduce stakeholder confusion. For example, California has established sea-level
rise guidelines, as have Florida and the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE).

Transportation agencies may want to partner with other groups that have experience developing or
using climate projections. Useful sources of information and assistance include:
 State Climatologist – In some States, the State climatologist may be able to provide information on
current climate research projects and existing projections that you could use that are relevant to
your study region.
 University climate research centers located in your region may already be doing research on
regional climate projections, and may be able to provide available data or be interested in
partnering on your research effort.
 State and local environmental or other agencies may be able to help provide or develop necessary
data. For example, local agencies may have access to LiDAR data or other data relevant to coastal
mapping.
 Experts in the area who can offer advice or assistance in developing projections.
 Federal agencies such as NOAA, USGS, USACE that have data, modeling, historic weather data, and
future climate predictions.
 The emergency response community who have been dealing with and planning for regular all
hazards events; people whose knowledge and expertise of short term events can be extrapolated
into long term climate change possibilities.

Examples from Practice: Identifying Climate Variables for Study

The differing objectives of the pilot studies resulted in a range of approaches:

Page 14

•

The San Francisco pilot limited its climate variables to sea level rise, storm surge and winddriven wave effects. Storm event impacts are already being experienced with the San Francisco
Bay, and future stronger and more frequent storms is likely to be the most burdensome, nearterm climate change impact to the region. The study selected sea level rise scenarios for midand end-of-century that were within the range of values included in the State of California Sea‐
Level Rise Interim Guidance Document (October 2010). The two sea level rise scenarios were
evaluated for three tide/Bay water level conditions (mean higher high water, the 100-year
extreme water level, and the 100-year extreme water level with wind-driven waves) by
leveraging regional modeling results from the USGS and FEMA.

•

The Gulf Coast 2 study examined temperature, precipitation, sea-level rise, and storm surge
variables. New, downscaled projections of temperature and precipitation for the study area
were developed for the study. Several temperature and precipitation values were chosen to be
projected, including a range of annual, seasonal, and extreme values [see Table 1]. Sea level rise
scenarios were developed based on literature reviews of global sea-level rise scenarios and an
assessment of historic subsidence/uplift rates specific to the area, and hurricane scenarios were
developed using historic storms as a base source of data.

•

The Oahu MPO pilot looked at potential sea-level rise, storm surge, wind, high intensity rainfall,
drought, and temperature effects on critical assets on the island of Oahu. The study made use of
climate projections from published literature and storm surge modeling from University of

The New Jersey pilot looked at sea-level rise, storm surge, extreme temperatures and
temperature ranges, extreme and average precipitation, drought, and inland flooding. The pilot
benefitted from assistance from their State Climatologist, and hired a consultant to develop
downscaled climate projections for the study area. The pilot also analyzed future floodplain
expansion using a regression model developed in a FEMA-sponsored study. Inputs to the model
included current and future climate variables.

•

The WSDOT pilot considered all known climate threats in the Pacific Northwest: sea level rise,
precipitation change, temperature change, and fire risk. The study used climate projections
funded and endorsed by an act of the Washington State Legislature for use in adaptation
studies, developed by the University of Washington Climate Impacts Group.

•

The Virginia pilot considered sea-level rise, storm surge, extreme temperature events, and
enhanced precipitation.

Assessing Vulnerability

Once the objectives and scope of the study have been defined, including a general outline of relevant
infrastructure and climate variables, practitioners can begin to assess the vulnerability of their assets.
The form, level of effort, and detail of the vulnerability assessment will vary based on the identified
objectives, goals, and other factors. The ultimate goal of the assessment is to determine how climate
change may impact the transportation assets included in the study. The findings of the assessment can
then be integrated into transportation decision-making processes and used to consider and prioritize
measures to address the vulnerabilities.
The assessment step in the framework will use the preliminary information and data on the relevant
climate variables and assets collected during the scoping of the study. However, data collection begun
as a part of project scoping will continue during the vulnerability assessment. Data collection is an
iterative, on-going process and is an integral part of the assessment.
Climate change and extreme weather vulnerability in the transportation context is a function of a
transportation system’s sensitivity to climate effects, exposure to climate effects, and adaptive capacity.
Sensitivity refers to how the asset or system fares when exposed to an impact. Related to sensitivity are
asset climate thresholds-the specific climate and environmental characteristics such as temperatures,
water flow, or precipitation pattern that may warrant changes to the transportation asset design or
materials. Section 3.1 discusses developing information on asset sensitivity to climate.
Exposure refers to whether the asset or system is located in an area experiencing direct impacts of
climate change, such as temperature and precipitation changes, or indirect impacts, such as sea-level
rise. To determine exposure, information on asset location, ideally including elevation information, is
combined with information on the extent of the climate impacts of concern. Section 3.2 discusses asset
data collection, and Section 3.3 discusses climate inputs.
Adaptive capacity refers to the systems’ ability to adjust to cope with existing climate variability or
future climate impacts. Are there alternate routes? How easily might impacted assets be modified to
adjust to changing climate conditions? Section 3.5 discusses adaptive capacity.
Information for vulnerability assessments can come in many forms ranging from quantitative data
driven GIS or spreadsheet computations to qualitative stakeholder engagement analyses based on local
knowledge of vulnerabilities. In practice, a vulnerability assessment may incorporate elements of both
qualitative and quantitative analyses, and there is no one-size-fits-all approach. Spatial and temporal
scale, objectives, and access to resources all may dictate different techniques.

3.1

Developing Information on Asset Sensitivity to Climate

A necessary step in a vulnerability assessment is identifying the ways in which the transportation assets
you are studying are sensitive to changes in the climate or to extreme weather events—that is, what are
the kinds of impacts they can experience, and at what thresholds are these impacts felt? There are a
number of different approaches that have been used to identify these sensitivities.
One source for sensitivity and threshold information are the standards or guidelines developed by State
DOTs or other industry organizations, such as standards for designing, constructing, and maintaining
infrastructure. Design standards and guidelines can be used to isolate specific climate stressors relevant
to a particular asset. The relationships provided within design standards can also be used to provide
quantitative indicators of an asset’s sensitivity to a particular climate stressor. Transportation
infrastructure is designed according to standards and guidelines that are based on detailed sets of
empirical tests, asset-specific quantitative models, and other engineering analyses. Engineers use these
documents to ensure that a design meets the functional specifications of a project within accepted
limits and factors of safety. Design standards and guidance consider relevant climate variables—both
typical climate characteristics in which the design will operate, as well as infrequent events such as
violent storms, floods, and hurricanes, whose occurrence is estimated through design return periods for
each hazard.
Related to design standards are design elements or relationships. For example a narrow, steep stream
may be more sensitive to increased flow than a relatively flat stream with wide floodplains. The narrow
stream may react more quickly and severely with rapidly rising water surface elevations and increased
velocities, whereas a flat wide floodplain may be able to distribute and store the increased flow,
effectively dampening the impacts. Relationships such as structure opening area to watershed size,
shape and slope may be useful as proxies for broad screens of sensitivity to increasing precipitation.
Incised streams, eroding stream banks, scour holes, presence of debris and signs of head cutting or
presence of vertical grade control structures can also provide warnings signs of sensitivity to increased
flow and instability. The ratio of culvert span or diameter to ponding depth at a roadway sag point may
also provide clues as to how much extra capacity that culvert might have available to it. All these
“proxy” relationships are useful for the initial sensitivity screening of assets in that they are usually
easier to detect or measure without having to perform more complicated hydraulic computations.
Another approach is to draw upon an agency’s experiences with system performance in the past,
especially during extreme weather conditions such as high temperature, heavy precipitation, flooding,
coastal storms, or prolonged lack of precipitation. Examining transportation system performance during
historic weather events can aid in understanding the sensitivity of the transportation system to weather
extremes and put the projected changes into context, teasing out the types of weather events and
thresholds that caused impacts to transportation facilities and operations. This information can be used
to gauge impacts associated with future climate conditions.
An assessment of past weather-related disruption and damage might consider:
•
•
•
•
•

Weather-related sources of disruption to transportation services.
Transportation assets currently affected by weather extremes.
Damage to roads or bridges, or supporting infrastructure (e.g., culverts).
Thresholds at which the system begins to experience impacts (e.g., a specific high temperature,
an amount of precipitation within a day or over several days that has led to damage or failure)
Locations within the system that experience impacts.

Climate Change & Extreme Weather Vulnerability Assessment

Page 17

Some of this information can be gleaned from existing studies; for example, if case studies exist on
failures of particular bridges or roads tied to weather extremes, these can be useful to develop an
understanding of the variables that caused failure. Where sufficient data are available (and in a readily
accessible format), maintenance and engineering logs can be consulted to find out more specifically
what types of weather events caused particular failures. This can range from the particular storm
surge level that closed a bridge temporarily (for safety concerns) or that caused damage to the bridge;
the levels of precipitation and stream flow at particular gages tied to culvert failure. Or, it could
involve examining maintenance records, and looking for links between particular changes in the
conditions of pavement and heat events.
Finally, district engineers and maintenance personnel are very often quite knowledgeable on the
weaknesses or vulnerabilities of the current system. Eliciting their expert opinion on sensitivities of the
current system can provide another way to determine how climate can impact the assets in the study.
How often does a particular road flood, and what are the weather and environmental conditions that
cause it? What temperature levels lead to enhanced pavement rutting and more rapid pavement
replacement? Are there certain roads that have been flooded due to coastal storms, and if so, what
kind of damage occurred as a result of particular storms? Do particular areas flood regularly at high
tide with mild storms?
It is important to recognize, however, that typical historical climate conditions are unlikely to be
representative of all future climate conditions. Although analysis of the past can yield useful “analogs”
for certain types of weather events and the resulting impacts, the climate is changing and some future
climate impacts may go beyond the range of impacts that have occurred in the recent past.
Furthermore, it is unlikely that the trends of past decades will persist unchanged into the future;
especially on longer timescales (greater than 30 to 40 years) simply extending past trend lines into the
future may underestimate future changes. For example, for all parts of the United States, the rates of
warming for the 21st century are expected to be greater than the rate of warming between 1900 and
2000. Similarly, sea-level rise rates have increased in recent decades, and they are expected to
increase still more in coming decades.

3.2

Collecting Data on Assets

Often the data needed for a vulnerability analysis will be found in multiple data sources that were
designed for unrelated purposes and are not easily merged together. Not all data sets are of
comparable quality, or in an easily accessible format (e.g., digital, geo-spatially referenced). For
instance, facility elevation data may only exist in “as-built” diagrams stored on paper. Different pieces
of information on the condition of the system facilities, for instance, might be found in a bridge
database, a pavement asset management system, and paper copies of culvert inspection reports.
Some data needed may not be collected regularly at all. The challenges of this data integration may be
a factor in determining what data to collect for the analysis.
3.2.1

Examples from Practice: Experiences with Data Collection and Integration

In inventorying State-owned transportation assets, the WSDOT quickly found that the information it
wanted to use was found in multiple data sources and that the information varied widely in its level of
detail and the extent of descriptive information included. The project team had to allocate additional
time to convert the varied data into a format that could be used with other data in the WSDOT’s GIS
Workbench. Some data, such as information on repeat maintenance events that the team had hoped
Page 18

Climate Change & Extreme Weather Vulnerability Assessment

Draft FHWA Climate Change and Extreme Weather Vulnerability Assessment Framework
to use to identify current vulnerabilities, was only available in the form of individual paper
maintenance reports and was not practical to use for this effort. Similarly, sea level rise (SLR) analysis
proved to be very complex and difficult to determine. Without accurate elevation values for the
roadway and infrastructure, it was difficult to determine whether an asset would be affected by the
chosen sea level rise scenarios. Given time and resource constraints, GIS analysis was limited to
proximity of an asset to the sea-level rise layers used in the database.
The New Jersey pilot gathered data from numerous sources and collected it into a geo-database for
querying and analysis. Table 2 details the data included in the geo-database. The pilot team
experienced some challenges with the data integration. For instance, their method for determining
critical assets was largely dependent on traffic analysis zone (TAZ) information. As the two New Jersey
study areas crossed the boundaries of three MPOs, with three separate travel demand models, they
needed to create a unified TAZ structure for the analysis. This procedure was time consuming.
Agencies with robust asset management systems may have central asset inventories to use as a strong
starting point. For example, SEPTA, the transit provider for Philadelphia, had budgeted resources for
asset inventorying as part of an FTA-funded climate adaptation pilot. However, because of a recent
FTA-funded asset management grant, SEPTA had a robust asset inventory in place and was able to
significantly reduce resources devoted to this task.

3.3

Developing Climate Inputs for the Vulnerability Assessment

In addition to identifying infrastructure of interest, other key pieces of information that serve as inputs
to the vulnerability assessment include understanding the sensitivity (and adaptive capacity) of the
infrastructure to climate/weather events and, importantly, establishing the projected future climate
scenarios this infrastructure will be (or is projected to be) exposed to. Development of climate
information supports both the historic look at sensitivity and the assessment of future exposure:
•

Information on past climate can inform agency understanding of the kind of weather and climate
effects transportation to which assets are sensitive and can inform development of thresholds of
future climate effects that may affect those assets. Thresholds for analysis can be developed tied to
the sensitivities identified in looking at past impacts. The thresholds could be for a specific asset or a
system. For instance, there might be a mean sea-level value at a storm drain outlet that causes
hydraulic grade line (HGL) to go above ground somewhere in the system given the current design
storm calculations. Or there might be a sea-level rise value that causes 30 percent of current storm
drain systems to violate HGL and/or permanently causes standing water on 10 percent of the road
network. Another example involves precipitation. A practitioner could relate design flows to a
design storm event, then establish how much higher a design storm event could be so that a specific
culvert does not overtop, or 10 or 30 percent of total culverts do not overtop. For both sea-level rise
and precipitation (design storm event) one can calculate a rate of approach to the intolerable level
based on historical measurements.

•

Information on future weather patterns and climate change effects, which translates to potential
exposure faced by transportation assets, should include examination and selection of a range of
future climate scenarios and the effects associated with the scenarios. Projected changes in climate
may include projections of particular thresholds that are deemed to matter; thresholds can be
identified through a sensitivity analysis or in design standards.

The future climate is generally expressed in the form of scenario-based projections, rather than single
predictions. These reflect the various uncertainties involved in climate modeling—the amount of
greenhouse gases that will be emitted (which depends on the rate and nature of economic growth,
technological change, and mitigation policies), climate variability, and model uncertainty. The emission
scenarios are generally based on a standard set of scenarios developed for Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change (IPCC) assessments. Each scenario represents a future path of global societal
development, with assumptions regarding population growth, economic growth, and technological
change, resulting in different rates of growth in greenhouse gas emissions. In order to reduce the
uncertainty and bias resulting from using just one climate model, these scenarios have been used to
create outputs from more than twenty major global climate models. As a result, climate projections
span a range of values, for which probabilities cannot be easily assigned. This means that in order to
better assess future risks, the vulnerability assessment will need to be conducted with a range of climate
inputs, rather than a single climate scenario.

3.3.1

Temperature and Precipitation

Projections of changes in temperature and precipitation can be complex. For general questions or for
issues covering large areas, broad geographic region modeling of changes in temperature and
precipitation may be sufficient. There are several reports 2 that provide this kind of information and use
it to assess impacts on particular regions of the United States and sectors within those regions. Regional
climate effects information can also help inform broad planning type questions, such as those where
broad trends in temperature and seasonal precipitation are of use. For other types of questions—
especially when the fate of specific transportation assets or areas of similar scale are the focus of the
analysis-- it is generally preferable to use more detailed information that has been processed to reflect
local features/topography and conditions. Such information and procedures for developing it are
becoming more available as progress is made on downscaling and regional modeling.
3.3.1.1

Examples from Practice: Temperature and Precipitation Projections

Approaches used in the New Jersey Pilot, the WSDOT Pilot, and Gulf Coast 2:
•

Modeling. Both the Gulf Coast 2 study and the New Jersey Pilot rely on statistical downscaling
methods applied to the study area. In the Gulf Coast study, the downscaling was done based on
historic temperature and precipitation information recorded at five stations in the Mobile region,
while in New Jersey eight stations were used. Washington State relied primarily on information
developed by the University of Washington Climate Impacts Group and other information developed
for the 2009 Washington Climate Change Impacts Assessment; the Washington’s Climate Impacts
Group downscaled information to the greater Columbia River basin.

•

Scenarios. The three efforts all used a range of global climate models and scenarios in developing
the information over a series of time periods. The New Jersey pilot used the B1 (low emissions), A1B
(moderate emissions), and A2 (high emissions) scenarios and used the results from 15 models.
Models were selected based on their ability to model precipitation for New Jersey. Gulf Coast 2
relied on model runs from 10 models for the B1 and A2, and four A1FI (high emissions based on
fossil fuel intensive growth) (A1FI has fewer model runs available); models were selected on their
ability to replicate results for North America, for both temperature and precipitation. Variables
were projected over three timeframes in Washington State and Mobile, and two timeframes in New
Jersey.

•

Extreme Values. In addition to directly-calculated variables (mean/high/low temperature and mean
precipitation) the assessments also developed projections for specific thresholds or extremes that
were derived from the model runs under each scenario. Examples include:

Estimating river flooding from heavy precipitation. For inland flooding from heavy rain, the New
Jersey pilot analyzed the impact of climate change on the 1-in-100 year floodplains. 3 To do this, the
project team used a national regression equation that was developed through a Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA) study. 4 The inputs to the equation are total number of frost days
annually (days below freezing), maximum number of consecutive dry days annually, and maximum
5-day rainfall during a given year (mm). 5 The project team generated these inputs specific to the
study area through analysis of climate models.
Using the statistical methods described above, the estimated future floodplains in the study areas
were an average 8 percent, 40 percent, and 59 percent wider in 2050 than the current 1-in-100-year
flood plain under the low, medium, and high emissions scenarios 6, respectively, and an average
17 percent, 80 percent and 178 percent wider than current floodplains in 2100. 81 miles of
roadways, 1120 transit bus route miles, and 26 NJ Transit track miles lie in the projected
1-in-100 year floodplain for 2100 under the medium emissions scenario.

3.3.2

Sea-Level Rise and Storm Surge

Sea-level rise and storm surge are potentially among the most destructive impacts climate change can
bring to coastal transportation infrastructure. In order to characterize exposure, most studies of sealevel rise and storm surge risk rely on spatial analysis of projected inundation. The GIS can be used to
map inundated areas by analyzing areas of land that fall below increased water levels under different
scenarios of sea-level rise (also called the “bathtub model”), while more sophisticated approaches
account for erosion, subsidence, and natural and man-made barriers that may protect certain areas
from inundation, or even model the flows of water over the landscape.
As described by NOAA (2009), inundation mapping involves the following key steps:
1. Gather elevation data and elevation surfaces for coastal land areas (includes calibrating
elevation to local tidal elevations); 7
2. Project sea-level rise and/or storm surge scenarios;
3. Use GIS to overlay the water surfaces onto the digital elevation map in order to identify
inundation areas; 8
3

The 1-in-100 year floodplain, also called 100 year flood or 1% flood, is the land area flooded during a heavy rain
event that has a 1% chance of occurring in any given year, or in other words, on average, once every one hundred
years.
4

Thomas et al., “Effects of Climate Change on the National Flood Insurance Program in the United States –
Riverine Flooding” Watershed Management 2010, ASCE, 2011.
5

These are the variables found in the FEMA study to be most highly correlated with the 1% annual chance flood
discharge, in cubic feet per second.

6

The emissions scenarios are those developed by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
(IPCC). The low scenario refers to the IPCC B1 scenario, the medium to A1B, and the high to A2.

7

Calibration often involves the choice of a vertical datum. As defined by NOAA (2011), “A datum is a base
elevation used as a reference from which to reckon heights or depths. A tidal datum is a standard elevation defined
by a certain phase of the tide. Tidal datums are used as references to measure local water levels.” Example tidal
datums include mean higher high water and mean high water.

8

The sea-level rise projection must be chosen to account for the vertical accuracy of the elevation data for the land
(and vice versa). An accurate map requires the root mean square error of the elevation data to be smaller than the

Climate Change & Extreme Weather Vulnerability Assessment

Page 23

Projections of global, or “eustatic,” sea-level rise scenarios can be found in the results from the IPCC or
other globally focused studies. Projections of local sea-level rise can be made more sophisticated by
accounting for a range of additional factors that influence water levels at regional and local scales, such
as:
•

•

•

In some locations, uplift or subsidence of the land surface can have a significant effect on the
rate of relative (or local) rise of sea level. Assessing changes in land subsidence or uplift is
relatively straightforward. Historic rates can be calculated and then be factored into
projections; this assumes that future rates will match historic rates.
Other factors, including changes in currents, salinity/density, and perhaps wind patterns can
have an impact on sea levels. These types of changes are less well understood, though the
science is evolving. For instance, on the coastline between North Carolina and Massachusetts,
sea-level rise rates have been much higher than the global average for the last two decades, and
the trend is expected to continue. Sea-level rise rates in the area are thought to be influenced
by changes in water temperature, salinity and density in the North Atlantic. 9
Ongoing coastal processes, such as changes in tidal flow and sediment volume, can also have a
major impact on shoreline characteristics. Barrier islands and wetlands (which may be a critical
defense against storm surge) may migrate or disappear, and storms, waves, and currents will
continually modify the landscape as the sea-level rises and exposes more land to wave action.

Storm surge scenarios can be developed from a number of different sources. Some of the most
frequently used options include:
•

•
•

•

Using data from NOAA tide gauges on the highest observed water level (HOWL) and combining
that with sea-level rise information to project the impacts of future sea-level rise and known
storm impacts. The HOWL measures the highest water level at a particular station, which is
linked to a particular storm (See The Potential Impacts of Global Sea Level Rise on
Transportation Infrastructure). Unfortunately, this method has its problems, as gauges
sometimes do not survive storms.
Mapping the exposure under past storms, and adding in sea-level rise (a version of the “bathtub
model” approach)
Modeling storms to include sea-level rise in the modeling. Computational models such as
ADCIRC or SLOSH estimate storm surge heights for historical or hypothetical storms based on
the topography for a specific locale. This approach is the most sophisticated and resource
intensive approach. (The Gulf Coast 2 study and the New Jersey Pilot used this approach.)
Leveraging ongoing or past regional modeling efforts. The San Francisco study used regional
models including the TRIM2D model results from USGS and FEMA Mike modeling conducted for
an ongoing bay flood study. Other localities may have regional modeling of extreme tides,
storm surge, or sea-level rise.

Although a simple “bathtub” approach may indicate the relative risk among areas, it may not serve as a
“prediction” for how the future landscape will appear, and thus may not capture all of the vulnerabilities
projected change in sea-level rise (NOAA 2009). For more in-depth discussion of land elevation data resolution and
accuracy, see Chapter 2 of CCSP (2009).

faced in a particular locale. Typically, such limitations are not critical for identifying areas at risk at broad
spatial scales (e.g., regionally or nationally) or communicating these risks to the general public.
However, they may be important to keep in mind when such maps are used for local land use planning.
The utility and accuracy of a sea-level rise and storm surge assessments depend in part on the resolution
of the underlying elevation data. One standard source of elevation data, the USGS National Elevation
Dataset, supplies elevation data with a horizontal resolution of 30m and 10m and vertical resolution of
around +/-2.4m. However, global projected sea-level rise of up to 2m by the end of the 21st century falls
within this +/-2.4m resolution. As such, maps based on the NED will generally not provide accurate
predictions of exposure of specific assets. In order to obtain more useful elevation information, local
assessments will likely need to rely on digital elevation models derived from high resolution LiDAR (Light
Detection and Ranging) data. These data are not available in all locations, and require additional
processing to use, including adjustments to the vertical datum to ensure consistency across datasets. 10
3.3.2.1

Examples from Practice:
Sea-Level Rise and Storm Surge Approaches and Other Considerations:

•

Elevation data — Most of the Pilots used high resolution LiDAR data, however, the Virginia
Pilot used the National Elevation Dataset (NED) to supplement the LiDAR data for areas left out.
LiDAR has a much higher vertical resolution, and is better for cases where project and planning
decisions will be made. LiDAR data have become increasingly available in recent years, and it is
a good idea to check with city or county agencies and the NOAA Coastal Service Center’s Digital
Coast to see if LiDAR data are available.

•

Sea level rise scenarios – Various studies examine a range of 0.3 to 2 meters of sea level rise
by 2100. It is a good idea to work with your State or local environmental counterpart to
establish sea-level rise ranges; in some cases, the State or local area may already have mandates
to consider specific ranges of sea-level rise. In New Jersey, the Department of Environmental
Protection (and the New Jersey Pilot) chose to look at three increments: 0.5, 1.0, 1.5 meters.
The San Francisco Pilot looked at 16 inches (0.4 meters) and 55 inches (1.4 meters) of sea-level
rise. The Oahu Pilot examined impacts tied to 0.75 and 1.9 meters. The Gulf Coast 2 project is
looking at 0.3, 0.75, and 2.0 meters.

•

Local sea level rise adjustment – Local sea-level rise can differ from global sea-level rise due
to a number of factors mentioned above, including factors such as subsidence/uplift of the land,
wind patterns, salinity and density of the water, and some of these factors are better
understood than others. Some studies have tried to account for these factors. For example, the
New Jersey pilot accounted for local subsidence as well as salinity and temperature. Gulf Coast

measurements and gauge estimates. In the Gulf Coast 1 project, rates of subsidence were
calculated at three tide gauge stations and used to represent the subsidence rates for the whole
Gulf Coast region. In the Gulf Coast 2 project, which focuses on one city on the Gulf Coast, rates
of subsidence/uplift were calculated for multiple areas in Mobile using changes in benchmark
surveys and satellite data. The two studies serve to bookend the range of options, and levels of

Adjustments to the vertical datum are a necessary part of mapping inundation. The land elevation data are usually
referenced to a vertical datum called the North American Vertical Datum of 1988 (NAVD88). This data is not tidal,
meaning that a value of 0 does not equate to any particular local tide value. Correcting this issue requires converting
the elevation data from NAVD88 to a tidal datum, such as mean high tide (NOAA, 2011).

sophistication, for calculating subsidence information. (This way of looking at historic change
also subsumes other factors, in addition to vertical land movement.)
•

Storm surge analysis – Analyzing the effects of storm surge can involve examining past storms

combined with projected future sea-level rise and/or changes in storms tied to climate change.
Various methods may be appropriate, depending on whether the results will be used for an
initial screen or used to make project-level decisions. A less resource intensive (and less precise)
option involves using the GIS to map combined sea-level rise and past storm surge levels; this
can be done using the NOAA tide gauge data tied to past storms (that is, the highest observed
water level (HOWL)). Modeling past storms using SLOSH or, using a model like ADCIRC, with
adjustments to SLR or other factors is another option. Models can also be applied to model
wave heights occurring on top of storm surge. Running a model like ADCIRC is quite resourceintensive, and few MPOs or DOTs have staff familiar with this model, though a model of its
sophistication may be necessary to analyze project level impacts. The New Jersey pilot used
SLOSH to look at several different storm scenarios. Gulf Coast 1 used SLOSH, and Gulf Coast 2 is
using ADCIRC to examine the impacts of multiple storm surge scenarios. The San Francisco pilot
leveraged existing FEMA modeling to obtain surge and wave height data to create inundation
maps.
•

Top-down guidance on sea level rise projections – Several State governments and

government agencies have issued requirements or recommendations on assumptions for sea
level rise for use in project development. Examples include California and the U.S. Army Corps
of Engineers, which is responsible for overseeing navigable waters in the United States.
California issued guidance on sea level rise in 2010 that mandated that all State agencies
consider a range of sea level rise scenarios for 2050 and 2100; the California Department of
Transportation issued its own guidance in 2011 that includes a range of sea level rise increments
over the coming decades and a process for considering whether and how to include sea level
rise projections in project planning. 11 The San Francisco Pilot examined transportation
vulnerability to two sea level rise scenarios, 16 inches by mid-century and 55 inches by end of
century, which was consistent with the California guidance. Similarly, the U.S. Army Corps
released a guidance memo in 2011 that notes that sea-level rise needs to be considered on its
projects and includes information on projected ranges of sea-level rise; the document also
includes a step-by-step process to help users calculate and incorporate a range of local sea-level
rise estimates. 12
•

Accounting for shoreline protections, wind, and waves – The San Francisco pilot took

shoreline assets (wetlands, levees, and similar features) into account when determining the
vulnerability of coastal transportation assets. This provides more actionable information than
simpler studies that only identify areas lying below a certain elevation. The pilot categorized
stretches of shoreline in a GIS mapping exercise into the following five categories:

These five categories are ordered above from those that provide the most potential protection
from inundation to the transportation infrastructure behind them to those that provide the
least potential for inhibiting inland inundation. The project team grouped the individual
shoreline assets into larger systems of protection that protected a certain area. The team
examined the sea level rise scenarios under three conditions: high tide, 100-year extreme water
level from storms, and 100-year extreme water level coupled with wind waves. The team then
analyzed the depth of water overtopping the asset and what percent of the length of the
shoreline asset system is overtopped.

Identifying and Rating Potential Vulnerabilities

There are multiple ways to combine the climate and asset information to identify potential
vulnerabilities, ranging from a desk review GIS or spreadsheet analysis to a stakeholder elicitation based
on local knowledge of current vulnerabilities, or a combination of both.
With the desk review approach, data on assets and projected climate are combined via a geospatial map
or other analytical tool to identify potential vulnerabilities. Projected climate change impacts are
represented in a GIS format along with information on the relevant assets (such as elevation, geographic
location, and existing flood protection) to determine potentially vulnerable areas.
With the stakeholder input approach, potential vulnerabilities are identified by stakeholders with
intimate knowledge of study area facilities. Through workshops and/or interviews, local transportation
practitioners draw from their knowledge and experience to consider how changes in climate may impact
transportation facilities within their purview.
3.4.1

Examples from Practice: Identifying and Rating Vulnerabilities

•

The San Francisco Pilot used a desk review approach. They considered exposure, sensitivity, and
adaptive capacity of assets in their assessment of sea-level rise vulnerability, giving each asset
ratings of high, medium, and low for the three criteria. They then developed an overall
vulnerability rating for each asset based on the ratings of the three criteria.

•

The New Jersey Pilot used the desk review approach. To identify vulnerable facilities from sealevel rise, storm surge, and inland flooding, they used GIS to determine intersections between
inundated areas and transportation assets. They converted the climate scenarios’ projected
inundation extents from raster format into polygons and conducted an intersect analysis to
determine the overlap with transportation asset lines and points. Results were illustrated in GIS
maps and exported to table format as in Figure 3 and Table 3, in this case indicating roadways
that would be inundated by one meter of sea level rise in the coastal study area.

The WSDOT pilot adapted a long-standing cost/risk assessment workshop model to gather
stakeholder input. The study team held workshops around the State with WSDOT employees
who knew each area well, such as the maintenance supervisor and their staff. Study organizers
asked “What keeps you up at night?” to help identify current vulnerabilities that may be
exacerbated in the future. Using projected climate information from the University of
Washington and other available information, workshop participants considered likely future
climate changes to sea level, temperature, precipitation, wind, and fire risks. They then assigned
an impact rating to each highway segment or asset ranging from 1 to 10 using an impact rating
scale scorecard (Table 4). The WSDOT’s workshop participants considered asset criticality
ratings as they rated the vulnerability of each facility or segment of highway. The ratings from
the workshops were collected into a central database and used to create maps identifying the
vulnerability level of each roadway segment or asset.

3.5

Considering Adaptive Capacity

Adaptive capacity refers to the ability of a system to adjust to climate change (including climate
variability and extremes) to moderate potential damages, to take advantage of opportunities, or to cope
with the consequences.
One way in which a transportation system can have greater adaptive capacity is if it has redundant
routes or modes. For instance, if a particular roadway segment is impassable due to flooding, the
availability of parallel routes or alternative modes can continue to enable travel between destinations.
The New Jersey pilot considered this aspect of adaptive capacity during its criticality screen. The pilot
ranked assets as more highly critical if there were no alternative routes available.
Another relevant criterion is how easily and quickly service can be restored to a segment or asset
following a climate-related disruption. The Gulf Coast 2 Study, for instance, is using two measurements
to evaluate how quickly service could be restored to a given segment: replacement costs and time
duration of disruptions. Replacement costs can provide a rough proxy for the ease in which assets could
be repaired or replaced; resources are more easily mobilized for lower cost repairs, and replacement
costs indicate overall complexity, size, and expense of the asset itself. Length of time for the disruption
to clear (for instance, for debris to be cleared from a rail line following a storm) is an indicator of how
well the system can deal with the climate impact. The availability of staffing and resources for
preventive measures can also increase adaptive capacity. For instance, SEPTA, the public transportation
provider for Philadelphia, provides the example of deploying maintenance crews prior to an expected
storm to trim trees along rail lines in order to minimize potential for wind-blown debris from trees to
block the tracks.
Key considerations for evaluating adaptive capacity include 13:
•
•
•
•
•

Is the system already able to accommodate changes in climate?
Are there barriers to a system's ability to accommodate changes in climate?
Is the system already stressed in ways that will limit the ability to accommodate changes in climate?
Is the rate of projected climate change likely to be faster than the adaptability of the system?
Are there efforts already underway to address impacts of climate change related to the system?

Ultimately, the vulnerability assessment will aid transportation decision-makers in prioritizing actions
and determining how to improve the adaptive capacity of the system.

3.6

Incorporating Likelihood and Risk

In addition to determining whether an asset may be impacted by climate change, it can also be
important to understand just how vulnerable the assets are. Information on risk and the timeframe of
the risk are useful for determining whether climate change should be considered in project

Draft FHWA Climate Change and Extreme Weather Vulnerability Assessment Framework
development, prioritizing actions, and weighing adaptation options. However, assigning risk associated
with climate change vulnerability is imprecise. It is not possible to apply a certain likelihood to a climate
scenario. And further, climate models do not all agree. This section provides a brief overview of
assessing climate risk to transportation assets, discusses some of the challenges to assigning a specific
risk, and offers examples of some ways transportation agencies have incorporated likelihood and risk
into their vulnerability assessments.
3.6.1

Assessing Risk

A risk assessment integrates the severity or consequence of an impact with the probability or likelihood
that an asset will experience a particular impact. To determine consequence, transportation agencies
may wish to consider the level of use of an asset, the degree of redundancy in the system, or the value
of an asset (in terms of cost of replacement, economic loss, environmental impacts, cultural value, or
loss of life). The consequence of projected impacts may have been a component of the vulnerability
assessment discussed in Section 3.4.
Determining the probability of occurrence, or likelihood, of future climate impacts, can be problematic.
As mentioned above, it is not possible to apply a particular likelihood to a climate scenario, and climate
models do not all agree. With the absence of information on the likelihood of specific climate impacts,
climate impact studies will often use separate risk matrices for a range of possibility with a “low
emissions” scenario and a “high emissions” scenario, or a range of emissions scenarios, as discussed in
Section 3.3. These studies will also use several climate models, often averaging results of those that
most accurately model past regional climate, and characterizing impacts that occur under all the models
“highly likely.” The resultant impact projections will be split into high- to low-likelihood groupings, with
the caveat that the climate may be more or less sensitive than we think. Depending on objectives and
study scope, the study team may want to choose projections from one scenario or a range of scenarios.
To the extent that information is available, impacts will be split into high- to low-likelihood groupings.
In general, there is much more certainty regarding the direction of change than there is regarding the
magnitude of change, or the length of time it will take to reach a change. For this reason, an agency
may want to consider impacts that are fairly certain to happen at some point this century, even if there
is some uncertainty regarding whether the impacts will occur in 2050 or 2080. With information on
consequence and likelihood, agencies can categorize assets into groups:
•

Assets that have a low likelihood of being impacted by a future climate condition and a low
consequence of being impacted by that condition.

•

Assets that have a low likelihood of being impacted by a future climate condition and a high
consequence of being impacted by that condition.

•

Assets that have a high likelihood of being impacted by a future climate condition and a low
consequence of being impacted by that condition.

•

Assets that have a high likelihood of being impacted by a future climate condition and a high
consequence of being impacted by that condition.

The integrated risk is often represented by a two-dimensional matrix that classifies risks into three
categories (low, moderate, high) based on the combined effects of their likelihood and consequence. An

Examples from Practice: Assessing Risk
The San Francisco pilot assessed risk of sea-level rise to two to three representative assets per
asset type identified as most vulnerable. The project team limited their study scope to “likely”
sea-level rise scenarios in both mid-century and end of century, thus they considered likelihood
of impact to be the same for all assets in the small study area. The study team acknowledged
that the while the projections used for mid-century (16 inches) and end of century (55 inches)
were not definitively tied to a specific date, the Bay will experience the amount of sea level rise
evaluated at some point in the future. They developed a consequence rating for each asset
included in the risk assessment by averaging ratings of six criteria. They combined likelihood
and consequence ratings to calculate an overall risk rating for each asset.

The Oahu MPO pilot used three day-long group work sessions of an interdisciplinary project
team to assess integrated risk to the five priority assets in their study. At the work sessions, the
team discussed likelihood, magnitude, and consequence to society of future climate change
impacts to each asset. Facility operators and other subject matter experts provided past
experience of the facilities to natural disasters and emergencies. Table 5 summarizes some of
the results of the integrated risk assessments, in this case the risk of sea-level rise to Honolulu
International Airport.

Rather than conducting a risk assessment per se, the New Jersey pilot developed a range of
scenarios designed to capture the potential range of possibilities. The scenarios were not
assigned specific likelihoods. The team used a total of three climate scenarios: low, medium,
and high emissions (the B1, A1B, and A2 scenarios) for both 2050 and 2100. They applied the
lowest emissions scenario to the least aggressive of 15 climate models that were deemed to
best replicate the local climate, the medium emissions scenario to the median climate model,
and the high emissions scenario to the most aggressive climate model, thereby creating a range
of projections. Similarly, for sea-level rise they selected low, medium, and high scenarios for
2050 and 2100 in consultation with the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection.
The study team recommended that NJ jurisdictions use the range of scenarios developed for the
study to examine their assets in more detail. They recommend using the high emissions/most
aggressive model scenario to analyze impacts to the most critical infrastructure, and the low
emissions/least aggressive scenario to analyze impacts to the least critical infrastructure.
However, to narrow the scope of their pilot study, the project team performed an analysis of all
assets in the study area based on the medium scenario.

4 Integrating Vulnerability into Decision Making
Once transportation vulnerabilities are identified, a logical next step is to consider how to address them.
Integrating results of the vulnerability assessment into decision making is important to ensure that study
results are used in practice. While the information developed from the vulnerability assessment should
be used to satisfy the study objectives, the results may also be useful in ways not initially anticipated.
This section includes strategies to effectively incorporate vulnerability assessment findings into practice.
While we include several in practice examples in this section, the FHWA’s initial round of vulnerability
assessment pilot projects was for the most part limited to the vulnerability assessment itself. The
FHWA will sponsor a second round of pilots with a goal of helping further the State of the practice in
applying vulnerability assessment results into decision making.

4.1

Identifying, Analyzing and Prioritizing Adaptation Options

Transportation agencies may choose to focus their efforts on those assets identified in the vulnerability
assessment as having high likelihood of climate impact and high consequence. For these assets, detailed
analysis of the costs and benefits of adaptation strategies could be conducted. Strategies might include
engineering new assets to withstand environmental conditions anticipated in the future (e.g.,
construction materials better suited to higher heat days), retrofitting existing assets (e.g., adding
barriers to prevent water incursion into tunnels), more intensive maintenance schedules (e.g., more
frequent cleaning of drains), systems planning (e.g., siting new facilities outside of expanded flood
plains), and improved operations plans for weather emergencies. Adaptation strategies should be
evaluated based on cost savings from avoided impacts as well as implementation costs. Strategies
should also be evaluated based on their feasibility, efficacy, ability to withstand a range of climate
hazards, and co-benefits.
Not many agencies have conducted these analyses to date. As such, the FHWA anticipates making this
section of the framework more robust based on experience with the second round of pilots.

4.2

Incorporating Vulnerability Assessment Results into Transportation
Programs and Processes

Incorporating vulnerability assessment results into existing and updated processes can be an effective
mechanism to implement lessons learned quickly and comprehensively. Use of the vulnerability
assessment results in this way can be seen as improving existing analysis and practice, rather than as a
separate and distinct activity. Considering climate change as one of many risks to be considered in
transportation decision-making rather than as a separate issue lowers barriers to adaptation. Agencies
may be able to incorporate climate change vulnerability assessment results into:

asset management;
emergency and risk management;
hazard mitigation plans;
transportation planning project selection criteria; or
environmental review.

The asset management process is a natural fit for incorporating climate change and extreme weather
vulnerability information. In many cases, existing infrastructure may not be up to handling climate
change and extreme weather events. Consideration of resilience, replacement, and restoration of assets
Page 36

Climate Change & Extreme Weather Vulnerability Assessment

Draft FHWA Climate Change and Extreme Weather Vulnerability Assessment Framework
can be integrated into asset management programs. Work on a vulnerability assessment can serve as a
launch point to begin looking at a State’s asset management system from the standpoint of climate
resilience.
State DOTs and MPOs have a strong interest in integrating climate change adaptation, hazard mitigation,
and transportation planning into a holistic planning process. In many communities, hazard mitigation
occurs separately from local planning processes, including transportation planning. This practice can
sometimes result in land use and transportation planning that inadvertently encourages development in
hazardous areas.
4.2.1

Examples from Practice: Incorporating Results into Transportation Programs and
Processes

•

The WSDOT incorporated results of their vulnerability assessment into their Guidance for
Project-Level Greenhouse Gas and Climate Evaluations (March, 2012). The guidance calls for
project teams to review the vulnerability assessment results as a first step to answering the
question “How will my project be affected by climate change?” The WSDOT maps developed as
part of the assessment summarize the assessment results, and can be used by project teams to
identify potential vulnerabilities in their project area. The WSDOT has published several
Environmental Impact Statements and NEPA Environmental Assessments containing information
about the relationship of the proposed project to a changing climate.

•

The Virginia Pilot developed a tool for incorporating vulnerability and risk assessment results
into the transportation planning process. The decision support tool helps to prioritize projects
in a transportation plan based on how they would address various issues, including climate
change vulnerability.

•

The Boston MPO incorporated climate vulnerability information into their transportation
planning process. To help identify areas where transportation infrastructure may be vulnerable to
natural hazards and to inform the security evaluation of proposed transportation projects, the MPO
undertook a hazard mapping project. They created an interactive Web tool that maps the
transportation network, natural flood zones, bridge condition, emergency routes, and
emergency support facilities. The tool links to the MPO’s database of Transportation
Improvement Program (TIP) projects and can be used to determine whether proposed projects
are located in areas exposed to flooding, storm surge, or sea-level rise. During project
evaluations, the MPO asks, “Will the project enable the facility to function in extreme weather
conditions?” and “Does it improve a facility that provides redundancy in a vulnerable area?”

The Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (LACMTA) recently added
climate adaptation considerations into its construction contracts. Under the environmental
provisions section of the contract, LACMTA specifies that the contractor must consider
projected climate impacts in the design and construction of the project and refers contractors to
the 2011 Federal Transit Administration (FTA) research report, “Flooded Bus Barns and Buckled
Rails: Public Transportation and Climate Change Adaptation,” for more information. LACMTA is
currently undertaking an FTA-funded project to integrate climate change information and
adaptation into the agency’s robust environmental management system (EMS).

The Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority (MARTA), the public transportation provider
for Atlanta, is incorporating climate impacts into its asset management system, including the
software system used for analyzing data on asset condition and prioritizing capital investments.
The public transportation providers for Philadelphia and Chicago (SEPTA and CTA) are similarly
marrying climate adaptation efforts with federally-funded asset management efforts.

•

Chittenden County MPO in Vermont is currently working with a Department of Housing and
Urban Development (HUD) grant to integrate climate change adaptation, hazard mitigation, and
transportation into a single planning document.

•

The Maryland State Highway Administration (MDSHA) uses its asset management system as a
climate adaptation tool. The agency collects data related to climate change and extreme
weather vulnerability in its Transportation Asset Management Program (TAMP) to better
analyze priority assets. These data include age, elevation, materials used, design lifetime and
stage of life, FEMA flood maps, current and historical performance and conditions, vegetation,
soil type, average daily traffic, bridge scour criticality, and length and width of bridges. [1] The
MDSHA has mapped and identified roads, bridges, and culverts vulnerable to sea level rise. In
addition, using 2011 road closure coordinates from CHART (Coordinated Highways Action
Response Team), the MDSHA plotted a GIS map labeled by category for the type of road closure
such as high water, debris, winter precipitation, or other type of incident. The analysis proved
useful for the agency’s vulnerability assessment as well as during emergency operations. For
instance, during Hurricane Sandy in October 2012, the State emergency management agency
used the 2011 road closure data layer in a geographic data mapping system called Osprey to
combine many other data layers and identify potential hazards. The Osprey system used
historical data on traffic and road closures collected by SHA to help improve storm response. [2]

•

The San Francisco pilot selected two vulnerable assets to test a methodology for analyzing
adaptation options. Using the information in the risk profiles developed by the project, the
team held a work session to evaluate strategies based on equity, economy, ecology, and
governance. The team notes that this was an initial, qualitative assessment that will need
further investigation to determine the real cost-effectiveness, applicability, and viability of
proposed adaptation measures.
One of the assets evaluated was the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge touchdown and toll plaza
on the Oakland side. The asset is protected by a combination of engineered shoreline
protection and wetlands. Even so, the shoreline protection would be overtopped under the mid
and late century sea level rise plus 100-year storm scenarios. This would inundate the bridge
touchdown and toll plaza as well as other transportation assets in the area (Interstate 80, West
Grand Avenue, Mandela Parkway, Burma Road, 7th Street Highway and Railroad Pumps, and
Union Pacific Martinez subdivision).

For asset-specific adaptation measures for midcentury, the team considered improved drainage,
retrofit, and raised road surface. Improved drainage around the freeway and toll plaza would
mean that when inundation occurs, there might be only partial closure of the roadway and,
after a storm/high tide event, water would drain off the road surface quickly enough to
minimize disruption. Retrofitting to better withstand temporary inundation would include
placing wiring and electronics for the toll plaza above the flood elevation and waterproofing
buildings and toll booths. Raising the road surface in areas identified as particularly vulnerable
could be done as part of regularly scheduled maintenance. For end-of-century, more expensive
measures may warrant consideration such as elevating the entire freeway above the end-ofcentury 100-year storm level. This might also provide benefits to the region because the raised
road could serve as a levee protecting West Oakland.
The team also considered regional adaptation measures for midcentury—creating a berm,
supporting wetland growth, and constructing a floodwall. For end-of-century the team
considered constructing levees, raising a floodwall built at midcentury, and building new
wetlands (It is unlikely that wetlands will be able to keep pace with sea level rise at the end of
the century).

Resources for Incorporating Results into Transportation Programs and Processes

FHWA Adaptation Peer Exchanges Final Report, FHWA, August 2012. This report synthesizes key
themes and lessons from a series of three FHWA-sponsored peer exchanges on climate change
adaptation, including examples of effective implementation practices presented by the MPO and State
DOT participants.
Flooded Bus Barns and Buckled Rails: Public Transportation and Climate Change Adaptation, FTA,
2011. This comprehensive FTA report on climate change adaptation for public transit includes a chapter
on implementation of climate change adaptation strategies at transportation agencies. There is also a
case study on Transport for London’s experience with asset management.
Eligibility of Activities to Adapt To Climate Change and Extreme Weather Events Under the Federal-Aid
and Federal Lands Highway Program, FHWA, 2012. This memo clarifies that Federal-aid and Federal
Lands highway funding may be used for climate change adaptation work. The memo notes that creating
a more resilient transportation system is a priority for the FHWA and provides some examples of eligible
uses of Federal-aid and Federal Lands highway funds to consider the potential impacts of climate change
and extreme weather events and apply adaptation strategies.

4.3

Stakeholder Engagement and Communication

It is difficult to overstate the importance of public stakeholder engagement in vulnerability assessment
and adaptation planning. If the target audience does not buy into the vulnerability assessment, it may
not support the resulting adaptation actions. The appropriate method of engaging stakeholders will vary
according to the agency, context, and objectives. It is very important to plan for a specific target
audience, and agencies often engage different groups of stakeholders in stages.
Successful engagement of internal staff requires listening and incorporating their feedback and
perspective. If these staff members are engaged and feel that they can take ownership over the
strategy, they may be more willing to provide valuable leadership and insight.

Climate Change & Extreme Weather Vulnerability Assessment

Page 39

Communicating the need for climate change adaptation is challenging for several reasons. First, people
often assume that “climate change” issues refer exclusively to mitigation. Organizations and
government agencies often house climate change adaptation efforts within traditional environmental
programs, even though adaptation impacts multiple programs, including asset management, risk
mitigation, operations, and planning. Second, the term climate change has become politicized, inhibiting
public agency communication and action in those jurisdictions where political forces do not wish to
address the issue. Lastly, it is difficult to communicate the range of uncertainty associated with climate
projections. For example, agencies are often concerned about releasing detailed inundation maps,
which might alarm and alienate coastal property owners because it is difficult to describe the specific
assumptions and uncertainties associated with these maps. Almost any adaptation assessment effort
will show increased vulnerability to flooding for coastal properties, but acknowledging potential
additional flooding vulnerability decreases the economic value of the property.
4.3.1

Strategies for Effective Communication

The 2010 pilots and participants in the FHWA sponsored peer exchanges have identified several
strategies for effectively communicating climate change vulnerability:
•

•

•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Page 40

In order to avoid confusing the issue of climate change adaptation with the politics of climate
change mitigation, some agencies use the terms “extreme events,” “event management,” “allhazard management,” and “resilience” as effective terms for communicating impacts and
adaptation issues.
Another strategy for communicating the need for adaptation is to expand conceptions of
sustainability and asset preservation to include resilience. Agencies can emphasize that climate
change adaptation is simple, good business practice that should be integrated throughout the
agency.
Frame adaptation as better planning and responsible risk management.
Frame adaptation as saving money. Stress that preventing impacts is almost always cheaper
than cleaning up and rebuilding after an extreme weather event.
Use past events, such as a memorable flood or heat wave, to help communicate the meaning of
climate projections.
Highlight possible solutions to climate impacts. Frame the issue as one of rising to the
challenge.
Use graphics.
Tailor the message to your audience.
Talk in the here and now. Explain how the climate is already changing in the geographic area the
audience is concerned with and the impact on assets and services that the audience values.
(Many individuals are not aware that climate change impacts are already occurring.)

Next Steps

Creating a more resilient transportation system is a priority for the FHWA and is consistent with a recent
U.S. DOT policy statement on climate change adaptation. 14 Analyzing and incorporating potential future
climate change impacts to transportation systems is a relatively new and evolving area of practice. One
of the FHWA’s goals is to ensure that State DOTs, MPOs, and local partners have the capacity to address
this relatively new area in their transportation plans and programs. A way that the FHWA is working
toward this is by developing and sharing information on tools and methodologies, such as those
highlighted in this document, that State DOTs and MPOs can use to assess climate change vulnerability
and risk, and to prioritize actions.
The FHWA plans to sponsor a new round of pilot projects in late 2012 through early 2014 to help fill in
gaps in this framework and to assist MPOs and State DOTs to advance climate change adaptation
activities more quickly. The FHWA anticipates that the selected pilots will fall into two distinct groups:
1) A continuation of vulnerability assessments similar to the first set of pilots only focused on concerns
specific to the interior portions of the country.
2) Advancement beyond the initial vulnerability assessment stage to development and implementation
of adaptation options.
Information on the new round of pilots, along with other FHWA research activities will be available on
the FHWA’s Climate Change Adaptation website.

Vulnerability Assessment Summaries
The WSDOT Study
The Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) assessed the infrastructure it owns,
including roads, rail, ferry facilities, and airports. The WSDOT held workshops around the State,
presenting information on climate projections and asking maintenance engineers and other
employees with intimate familiarity with the assets, "What keeps you up at night?" to help identify
current vulnerabilities that may be exacerbated in the future.
Washington State Department of Transportation, Climate Impacts Vulnerability Assessment, November
2011.
The New Jersey Study
The New Jersey project was led by the North Jersey Transportation Planning Authority and was
supported by an interagency partnership, including the three New Jersey MPOs, the New Jersey
Department of Transportation, New Jersey Transit, the New Jersey Department of Environmental
Protection, and the New Jersey State Climatologist. The pilot closely followed the three steps of
the Conceptual Risk Assessment Model in its analysis of the New Jersey Turnpike/I-95 corridor and
the New Jersey Coast.

The OahuMPO Study
The Oahu Metropolitan Planning Organization (MPO) used an interagency, multidisciplinary 2-day
workshop to facilitate a climate change dialog and identify five key vulnerable assets for further
study. The five assets were then assessed in more detail by transportation experts in three full-day
work sessions.

The Virginia Study
The University of Virginia developed a priority setting tool to assess how consideration of climate
change and other factors may affect project prioritization in a transportation plan. The State used
the Hampton Roads region as a case study.

Climate Change Effects on Transportation Infrastructure, Hampton Roads, VA Pilot, November
2011.
The San Francisco Study
The Metropolitan Transportation Commission, in partnership with the San Francisco Bay
Conservation and Development Commission, the California Department of Transportation District
4, and others, led a study of a portion of the Bay, stretching from the San Francisco-Oakland Bay
Bridge to the San Mateo Bridge (Alameda County). This study was focused on sea level rise. The
project team developed profiles of risk to sea level rise for a list of representative and unique
assets within the study area, including exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity.

The Gulf Coast Study
To better understand potential climate change impacts on transportation infrastructure and
identify adaptation strategies, the US DOT is conducting a comprehensive, multi-phase study of
climate change impacts in the Central Gulf Coast region. This region is home to a complex
multimodal network of transportation infrastructure and several large population centers, and it
plays a critical national economic role in the import and export of oil and gas, agricultural products,
and other goods. The study is sponsored by the US DOT's Center for Climate Change and
Environmental Forecasting in partnership with the USGS and is managed by the FHWA.
Gulf Coast Phase 1
Phase 1 (completed in 2008) examined the impacts of climate change on transportation
infrastructure at a regional scale, investigating risks and impacts on coastal ports, road, air,
rail, and public transit systems in the central Gulf Coast, with a study area stretching from
Houston/Galveston, Texas, to Mobile, Alabama. The study assessed likely changes in
temperature and precipitation patterns, sea-level rise, and increasing severity and
frequency of tropical storms. Phase 1 then explored how these changes could impact
transportation systems.
Gulf Coast Phase 2
Phase 2 focuses on the Mobile, Alabama, region -- with the goal of enhancing regional
decisionmakers' ability to understand potential impacts on specific critical components of
infrastructure and to evaluate adaptation options. In Mobile, the U.S. DOT is assessing the
vulnerability of the most critical transportation assets to climate change impacts. The U.S.
DOT will then develop risk management tools to help transportation system planners,
owners, and operators determine which systems and assets to protect and how to do so.
The methods and tools developed under Phase 2 are intended to be replicable to other
regions throughout the country. Phase 2 is scheduled to be completed in 2013.

13. ABSTRACT (Maximum 200 words)

The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) conducted an international review to study how international transportation agencies are
addressing issues related to adapting highway infrastructure to the impacts of climate change. The review involved transportation agencies
from Australia, Canada, Denmark, Korea, New Zealand, the Netherlands, Norway, and the United Kingdom. The review elicited information on
adaptation issues associated with all aspects of the transportation project delivery process. This synthesis report highlights the state of the
practice of how transportation agencies are addressing climate adaptation through the following: adaptation frameworks/strategies; climate
change risk assessments; selecting adaptation measures and strategies; long range planning and land use; changes in design standards;
maintenance and operations; asset management; and research. The information collected during the review and presented here is relevant to
transportation planners, asset managers, design engineers, and policy-makers.

Executive Summary
Global climate change poses serious challenges to the transportation community. Climate change
effects, such as changes to long-term annual average temperatures and precipitation patterns,
increased frequency and intensity of storm events and heat waves, and rising sea levels, have direct
implications on the planning, design, construction, operations and maintenance of transportation
systems. In recent years, many transportation agencies in the United States have begun to assess the
risks that their transportation systems and operations face and the vulnerabilities that they have due to
climate change impacts. However, even the most proactive agencies are in the early stages of
developing and implementing adaptation strategies and are keen to learn from the experiences of
peers, including those internationally.
The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) conducted a virtual international review to study how
transportation agencies worldwide are working to adapt highway infrastructure to the impacts of
climate change. The review team spoke with staff from the following agencies on adaptation issues
associated with all aspects of the transportation project delivery process, including policy development,
planning, design, construction, operations, and maintenance:
•

VicRoads, Victoria, Australia

•

New Zealand Transport Agency, New Zealand

•

Vejdirektoratet (Danish Road Directorate), Denmark

•

Rijkswaterstaat (Ministry of Infrastructure and the Environment), Netherlands

•

Korea Expressway Corporation (KEC), Republic of Korea

•

Department for Transport, United Kingdom

•

Highways Agency, United Kingdom

•

Statens vegvesen (Public Roads Administration), Norway

•

Transport Canada, Canada

While there is considerable confidence in climate model estimates for future climate change, the exact
timing and magnitude of climate change effects as well as their precise impacts on roadway
infrastructure and logistics is uncertain. The uncertainty is related to unknown future emissions levels;
climate models limitations, and a lack of information on the degree of effectiveness of adaptation
strategies. Nevertheless, transportation agencies still must make decisions about and investments in
their road networks.
Key Findings and Observations
This synthesis report highlights proactive actions that international transportation agencies are taking to
address uncertainties connected to climate change and to manage the associated risks. The report
highlights the following state of the practice:
•

Adaptation frameworks/strategies: An adaptation framework or strategy is a foundation for an
organization to implement adaptive actions. It provides a sound basis for decision-making when
confronted with climate uncertainties. Several of the countries - included in the review – namely
Canada, Denmark, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, and the United Kingdom have
developed climate adaptation strategies and policies at the national level. Although the levels of

International Practices on Climate Adaptation in Transportation | i

detail in these documents vary, common elements typically found include a brief description of
climate change predictions, an assessment of associated risks and/or vulnerabilities, and
identification of a process of how to address and respond to the risks and vulnerabilities. These
national strategies have in turn influenced the climate adaptation strategies their transportation
agencies have developed.
•

Climate change risk assessments: Several of the transportation agencies that participated in the
review are employing systematic methods to address some of the inherent uncertainties and to
manage the associated risk. The purpose of a climate change risk and/or vulnerability
assessment is to determine how climate change may impact an agency’s transportation assets
and prioritize measures to maximize impact and minimize costs. The Danish Road Directorate
follows the Blue Spot method – a four level analysis to identify roadway locations where the
likelihood of floods is high and the consequence of flooding is significant. Similarly, the
ROADAPT research project, a joint research effort supported by a number of European
countries, developed a preliminary risk assessment method that can identify vulnerable
locations in the transportation network, understand the probabilities and consequences that
climate change events could have on these locations, and provide options for adaptation
actions.

•

Changes being implemented in long range planning and land use processes: Incorporating
climate change impacts and climate data into long range transportation planning and land use
decisions can play a significant role in both mitigating and adapting to climate change. The
United Kingdom requires that applicants seeking approval for Nationally Significant
Infrastructure Projects must take climate change effects into consideration when planning the
facility’s location, design, construction, and operation. Similarly, the New Zealand Government
provides best practice information and guidance to local authorities on integrating climate
change considerations, including sea level rise, into land-use planning and decision-making
processes. The Guidance Manual includes specific recommendations for the degree of sea level
rise to consider.

•

Integrating climate change into design standards: Several international transportation agencies
have begun to integrate climate projections into design criteria and specifications for
transportation infrastructure projects. Examples include the Danish Road Directorate’s new
drainage standards, the Korea Expressway Corporation’s bridge design countermeasures, which
include requirements for new bridges to be designed for a 200-year return period (instead of a
100-year return period) and have a minimum freeboard of 2 meters. The agency is also adapting
in-service bridges at low elevation by either reconstructing them or raising their heights by 1 to
3 meters. The Norwegian Public Roads Administration also recently updated its planning, design
and construction manuals to integrate adaptation measures.

•

Maintenance and operations: Climate change impacts will likely necessitate changes in the ways
transportation agencies operate and maintain their systems and facilities. Some of the agencies
participating in the review are making minor changes to maintenance and operation activities,
though most indicated that they are not at the point where climate change impacts have
directly translated to changes in their maintenance practices. Examples of changes that agencies
are making include: increased field inspection of drainage systems; providing traveler
information to address weather-related safety; installing traffic safety and warning measures;
and improving emergency plans.

•

Asset management practices: Climate change impacts will likely alter transportation asset

International Practices on Climate Adaptation in Transportation | ii

management investment cycles. Several of the transportation agencies included in the review
are actively integrating climate change considerations into their asset management plans.
Examples include the Korea Expressway Corporation’s new preventative slope management
strategy, which is designed to prioritize slopes for preventative maintenance and reduce the
amount of money spent on emergency relief, and the New Zealand Transport Agency’s Coastal
Effects Assessment Guideline, which outlines a simple, consistent, and comprehensive process
for asset managers to determine short- and long-term risks to state highway assets in the
coastal environment.
•

Research: Many of the transportation agencies included in the review are participating in
collaborative research initiatives that address critical information and data needs related to
climate change adaptation. These collaborative research efforts include two research programs
from the European Road Association that focus on climate change adaptation. The first effort,
Road Owners Getting to Grips with Climate Change, was designed to provide European road
authorities with the knowledge and tools necessary to "get to grips" with climate change and its
impacts on all elements of road management by adapting design rules, updating and improving
data collection, and developing risk management methods. The second program focused on
providing owners with adaptation technologies and the models and tools to support
decisionmaking concerning adaptation measures for road infrastructure.

1. Introduction
1.1 Background and Purpose
Global climate change poses serious challenges to the transportation community. Climate change
effects, such as changes to long-term annual average temperatures and precipitation patterns,
increased frequency and intensity of storm events and heat waves, and rising sea levels, have direct
implications on the planning, design, construction, operations, and maintenance of transportation
systems. Climate change adaptation is the practice of implementing actions to avoid, withstand, or take
advantage of current and projected climate changes and impacts. Adapting transportation infrastructure
to anticipated climate change impacts is critical to avoiding or at least minimizing potential damage,
disruption in service, and safety concerns.
In recent years, many transportation agencies in the United States have begun to assess the risks that
their transportation systems and operations face and the vulnerabilities that they have due to climate
change impacts. However, even the most proactive agencies are in the early stages of developing and
implementing adaptation strategies and are keen to learn from the experiences of peers, including those
internationally.
The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) conducted a virtual international review to study how
international transportation agencies are addressing issues related to the adaptation of highway
infrastructure to the impacts of climate change, and to identify innovative and best practices that could
implemented in the United States to help advance the development and implementation of adaptation
strategies. The review involved nine agencies that were chosen based on their leadership in the climate
adaptation field. Agencies that participated in the review were:
•

VicRoads, Victoria, Australia

•

New Zealand Transport Agency, New Zealand

•

Vejdirektoratet (Danish Road Directorate), Denmark

•

Rijkswaterstaat (Ministry of Infrastructure and the Environment), Netherlands

•

Korea Expressway Corporation (KEC), Republic of Korea

•

Department for Transport, United Kingdom

•

Highways Agency, United Kingdom

•

Statens vegvesen (Public Roads Administration), Norway

•

Transport Canada, Canada

The adaptation efforts for transportation infrastructure underway in these countries are diverse in
scope and application, reflecting a broad array of geographic, environmental, and societal conditions
much like those found across the United States.
The scope of the review corresponds with the wide-ranging and multidisciplinary implications of climate
change on transportation infrastructure. The review elicited information on adaptation issues associated

International Practices on Climate Adaptation in Transportation | 1

with all aspects of the roadway transportation project delivery process, including policy development,
planning, design, construction, operations, and maintenance. The compiled information presented here
is relevant to transportation planners, asset managers, design engineers, and policy-makers.

1.2 Methodology
The review team included staff from FHWA’s Offices of Natural Environment; Asset Management,
Pavements, and Construction; Bridges and Structures; and International Programs; and staff from the
Volpe National Transportation Systems Center. The review team determined which agencies to include
in the review using information from three primary sources: reports on prior related scanning studies;
published literature; and knowledge from experts in the field. Once the agencies were selected, the
review team reached out to an initial point of contact at each agency to identify appropriate point of
contact(s) who could participate in one, 1.5-hour web-based meeting. The review team provided each
interviewee with a list of discussion topics about which FHWA was interested in learning more (see
Appendix A).
The review team then conducted web-based meetings with each of the nine agencies. See Appendix C
for a list of interview participants. The format of the meetings allowed for discussion over the phone
with concurrent sharing of presentations and documents online. The review team conducted the
interviews between May and September 2014. Finally, the review team reviewed research reports and
official agency documents that the peer agencies provided in supplement to the information discussed
during the interviews (see Appendix D).

2. Adaptation Strategy
An adaptation strategy or framework is a foundation for an organization to implement adaptive actions.
It provides a sound basis for decision-making when confronted with climate uncertainties. Several of the
countries included in the review have developed climate adaptation strategies and policies at the
national level. These national strategies have in turn influenced the climate adaptation strategies their
transportation agencies have developed.
The following section highlights the adaptation strategies and frameworks for the agencies included in
the review who have established formal frameworks. Although the levels of detail in these documents
vary, common elements typically found include a brief description of climate change predictions, an
assessment of associated risks and/or vulnerabilities, and identification of a process of how to address
and respond to the risks and vulnerabilities.
Canada’s Federal Climate Change Adaptation Framework
Environment Canada developed a Federal Adaptation Policy Framework that guides the Government’s
domestic adaptation actions. This Framework sets out a vision, objectives, roles of the federal
government, and criteria for identifying adaptation priorities. The Framework identifies three key
themes to the Federal Government’s role in climate change adaptation:
•

Generating and sharing knowledge and building adaptive capacity to respond

•

Integrating adaptation into federal policy and planning

•

Using convening power to facilitate collaboration amount stakeholders and sectors

Building upon the Federal Framework, Transport Canada developed its first Climate Adaptation Action
Plan in 2013. The Adaptation Plan is the department’s first step in addressing and identifying gaps, risks,
and opportunities related to adaptation, and sets the stage for future action. The plan includes an action
plan that outlines goals and objectives that align with the Federal Framework, and identifies specific
actions that the department will take to achieve those goals.
Denmark: Strategy for Adapting to Climate Change
In 2012, the government of Denmark developed an Action Plan for a Climate-Proof Denmark, which
identified a series of initiatives that different government entities, including the Ministry of Transport
and the DRD, are conducting or have planned to ensure that the country will become more resilient to
climate change. Building off the overarching guidance and commitments in this plan, the DRD published
its Strategy for Adapting to Climate Change in 2013. The aim of this document is to ensure DRD takes
actions to address climate change in the most economically responsible and efficient manner. DRD’s
climate strategy is focused on road flooding, which is the agency’s central challenge associated with
climate change impacts. The DRD’s climate strategy involves a three-pronged approach to addressing
increased rainfall and water on roads: “we manage, we improve and we prevent.” DRD carries out this
approach as follows:
1. Manage flooding when it occurs. When flooding occurs, the DRD will close affected roadways,
provide information to warn motorists, and work to clear up incidents quickly.
2. Make improvement to roads. After a road flooding, DRD will analyze the event and conduct a
cost-benefit analysis to identify a financially viable improvement. As part of this work, the DRD is
developing a database of climate events in order to understand climate impacts at a national
level. The DRD has defined climate events as a “complete or partial closure of a national road, or

International Practices on Climate Adaptation in Transportation | 3

part of that road, for the duration of more than one hour, as a result of water on the road
surface.” Additionally, DRD is committed to cooperating with relevant authorities to better
coordinate activities and ensure they capitalize on opportunities to reduce risk.
3. Prevent wherever it is possible. The DRD has determined that it is not necessary or economically
feasible to prevent all climate events on the road network. In order to prioritize actions, the DRD
conducts Blue Spot Analysis to screens for particularly vulnerable areas (see Chapter 3 for more
information on the Blue Spot Analysis). The agency is also proactive about considering climate
change in the planning and construction phases in order to climate-proof – make more resilient
to climate change - new infrastructure.
DRD is now developing an action plan to carry out its climate change strategy. The action plan will
describe climate adaptation actions more fully and assign responsibility for implementation of these
actions.
The Netherlands Delta Programme
The Netherlands is a low-lying country that is vulnerable to flooding. The country’s Delta Act, which took
effect in 2012, requires a Delta Programme, which involves the development of yearly plans to protect
the country from high water and ensure a sufficient supply of freshwater. Since the Delta Programme is
designed to address future impacts, many of which are uncertain, Delta Scenarios were developed to
help manage the uncertainty. The four scenarios (see Figure 1) take the relationship between socioeconomic trends and climate change into account. The initial Delta Scenarios, which were developed in
2012, were based on the climate scenarios of the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute (KNMI). In
2014, the KNMI incorporated the latest insights into its scenarios. The changes were so slight that it was
not necessary to adjust the Delta Scenarios as they still corresponded to the range of plausible future
changes.

International Practices on Climate Adaptation in Transportation | 4

Figure 1: Description of Delta Scenarios
Source: Delta Programme

The annual Delta Programme identifies measures and projects to adapt physical systems, such as dykes
and pumps, as well as spatial planning strategies (i.e. prohibiting construction in some locations, raising
structures in others, etc.) to proactively manage flooding. Delta Programme 2015 outlines final
proposals for addressing water safety and fresh water supply in the country. A key measure in the 2015
Programme is a new approach to water-safety standards. The new standards are based on a risk-based
approach, in which the risk of flooding and the possible consequences are taken together to determine
the safety standard level (the current approach only looks at a flood water level being exceeded). The
2054 Programme outlines three types of measures that will be implemented to manage flood risk:
•

Layer 1: preventive measures to limit the probability of a flood;

•

Layer 2: spatial organization of an area to limit consequences of a flood and, in specific cases, to
contribute directly to the desired level of safety;

•

Layer 3: disaster management to limit the consequences of a flood in terms of causalities.

The government aims to have the new water-safety standards embedded in law by 2017. The goal is to
have all flood defense systems meet the new standards by 2050. The Netherlands has a Climate Agenda
(2013) addressing both mitigation and adaptation aspects and plans to adopt a national adaptation
policy, which will be broader than infrastructure alone, by 2017.
New Zealand: State Highway Resilience Programme Business Case
New Zealand’s 2010 National Infrastructure Plan outlined New Zealand’s priorities for infrastructure and
highlighted future investments for all major sectors, including transportation. This plan also
acknowledged the need to consider climate change adaptation as part of the planning and development
process for new infrastructure projects. In the subsequent 2011 National Infrastructure Plan,
infrastructure resilience emerged as a guiding principle, driven in part by two major earthquakes in the
country’s Canterbury region. In the 2011 plan, the New Zealand Government set a new vision for
infrastructure, committing to create resilient infrastructure that is coordinated and contributes to

International Practices on Climate Adaptation in Transportation | 5

economic growth and increased quality of life. According to the plan, “the concept of resilience is wider
than natural disasters, and covers the capacity of public, private and civic sectors to withstand
disruption, absorb disturbance, act effectively in a crisis, adapt to changing conditions, including climate
change, and grow over time” (p. 14). Thus, in this plan, climate change adaptation is a way to achieve
resilience.
In response to the National Infrastructure Plan and several significant highway emergency events, the
New Zealand Transport Agency recently released a State Highway Resilience Programme Business Case.
This business case establishes the rationale for investment in a program of works to ensure the Agency
has the capacity to withstand, absorb, adapt to, and recover from disturbance and change conditions
and to grow over time as required to meet demands. The Business Case is focused on understanding
risks, such as those posed by sea level rise, and concentrating efforts on where the risk to the state
highway network is greatest. By 2017, the Transport Agency aims to have a national infrastructure
network investment and management approach to resilience, which will be incorporated into the 20182021 three-year National Land Transport Plan (New Zealand Transport Agency, 2014).
Norway: National Climate Change Adaptation Strategy
In 2013, the Norwegian Parliament issued a national strategy for climate change adaptation, which
established a common framework for climate change adaptation across sectors and administrative
levels (Meld. St 33, 2013). The strategy emphasizes building scientific knowledge on which to base policy
decisions and strengthening that knowledge through collaboration across sectors and levels of
government. As a precautionary approach, the strategy recommends that assessments of the impacts of
climate change should be based on figures from the high end of the range of national climate
projections. The national strategy provided the Norwegian Public Roads Administration with the political
framework to advance its climate adaptation work.
United Kingdom: Highways Agency Climate Change Adaptation Strategy and Framework
The Climate Change Act of 2008 was the first major policy action that raised the profile of adaptation
work in the UK. The Government charged major infrastructure owners, including transport companies,
with assessing the risks to their assets and the operation of their assets to the projected changes in
climate. Infrastructure owners were required to submit climate change risk assessment information to
the Department of Environment, Food, and Rural Affairs. As an Executive Agency of a Government
Department, the Highways Agency was not required to report; however, it voluntarily agreed to report
information.
The Highways Agency published its Climate Change Adaptation Strategy and Framework in 2009. The
Framework lays out a strategic model to assessing and understanding the risks posed to the strategic
network. The model (see Figure 2) provides a platform for decision makers to examine their individual
business areas, including standards, specifications, maintenance, and the development and operation of
the Highways Agency network. It provides a process for identifying agency activities that are expected to
be impacted by climate change (defined as “vulnerabilities”), assessing associated risks and
opportunities, and determining the most appropriate actions to address and manage these risks.

Figure 2: Highways Agency Adaptation Framework Model
Source: UK Highways Agency

Using the Adaptation Framework Model, the Highways Agency identified over 80 corporate activities
that may be affected by climate change. After conducting a preliminary appraisal of the risks associated
with these activities, the Highways Agency discovered that over 60 percent of the activities will likely be
substantially impacted by climate change and are thus time-critical. The Highways Agency prioritized
vulnerabilities based on a variety of criteria, including the extent and severity of the disruption a
climate-change event could cause. The Highways Agency then used this list of priorities to go through an
options analysis to determine the preferred option for dealing with the risks associated with each of the
vulnerabilities. Next, the agency moved forward with the development and implementation of
“Adaptation Action Plans” that outline the specific actions that need to be taken, who is responsible for
the actions, and the timeframe for carrying them out.

3. Climate Change Vulnerability and Risk Assessment
While there is considerable confidence in climate model estimates for future climate change, the exact
timing and magnitude of climate change effects as well as their precise impacts on roadway
infrastructure and logistics is uncertain. The uncertainty is related to unknown future emissions levels;
climate models limitations, and a lack of information on the degree of effectiveness of adaptation
strategies.
Several of the transportation agencies that participated in the review are employing systematic methods
to address some of the inherent uncertainties and to manage the associated risk. The purpose of a
climate change risk and/or vulnerability assessment is to determine how climate change may impact an
agency’s transportation assets and prioritize measures to maximize impact and minimize costs. Risk
assessments often rely on both quantitative data and a qualitative analysis based on local knowledge of
vulnerabilities. The following section highlights the climate change risk assessment methods that
transportation agencies involved in the review are employing.
Denmark’s Blue Spot Project
The DRD’s Strategy for Adapting to Climate Change notes that it is neither necessary nor economically
feasible to prevent climate-related events across the entire national road network. Instead, the
Directorate applies the Blue Spot method to identify the locations on the national road network that are
most vulnerable to flooding and to determine whether improvements to those road sections are
economically viable. The Blue Spot analysis is a central activity that supports the agency’s goal of
achieving the highest degree of climate adaptation with available allocated resources.
A Blue Spot is an identified stretch of roadway where the likelihood of flooding is high (determined by
perception return patterns) and the consequence of flooding (quantified by socioeconomic factors, such
as safety, traffic management systems, and traffic intensity.) is significant. The Blue Spot method uses a
geographic information system (GIS)-model , comprised of three levels:
•

Level 1 provides a screening of all terrain depressions which are computed based on a
hydrologically adapted digital terrain model.

•

Level 2 produces a risk map by incorporating the amount of rainfall needed to fill a given
depression alongside the integration of the imperviousness of the catchment area.

•

Level 3 couples terrain characteristics with drainage system specifications in order to determine
depths and retention time of a flooding scenario. An important aspect of Level 3 is the
incorporation of climate factors, in terms of changing precipitation pattern, to enable model
outcomes from the present time and from the year 2050 and 2100. With this information the
model is able to identify Blue Spots in 2100 which may not exist under present day conditions.

The DRD uses the information from the Blue Spot analysis to inform funding decisions in terms of
prioritizing locations to address, as well as to inform adaptation actions for a specific location.
Nationwide the agency has identified 14 Blue Spots under present day scenarios, and an additional 35
Blue Spots have been identified for 2050 and beyond. The DRD compares the identified Blue Spots
against each other to determine where funding and adaptive measures should be targeted first and
most effectively. For individual locations, the agency also uses the Blue Spot analysis to conduct a costbenefit analysis to determine what should be done to address risk and consequence.

International Practices on Climate Adaptation in Transportation | 8

Both the Swedish Transportation Agency and the Dutch Ministry of Infrastructure and the Environment
have adopted the Blue Spot method to identify areas vulnerable to flooding. The results of the Dutch’s
analysis on the Dutch highway network was followed by an investigation of the risks of flooding and
further identification of critical assets. The results of this assessment were used to provide information
to the public in the case of major floods and to investigate the implications for evacuations and risk
management.
Roads for Today, Adapted for Tomorrow (ROADAPT)
The ROADAPT project was a joint research effort supported by the Netherlands, Germany, Denmark,
and Norway. The primary objective of ROADAPT was to develop a preliminary risk assessment method
that can identify vulnerable locations in the transportation network, understand the probabilities and
consequences that climate change events could have on these locations, and provide options for
adaptation actions. The outcome of ROADAPT was guidelines on:
A. The use of climate change projections
B. The application of a QuickScan on climate change risks for roads
C. How to perform a detailed vulnerability assessment
D. How to perform a socioeconomic impact assessment
E. How to select an adaptation strategy
The ROADAPT guidelines are available to download on the Conference for European Directors of Roads website.
Below is a description of guidelines B, C, and E.
Application of QuickScan
QuickScan is a climate change risk assessment method that provides preliminary estimates of the major
risks associated with weather conditions in the current climate and in future climate projections.
QuickScan does not use extensive quantitative analyses; rather, it is a semi-quantitative approach that
relies on stakeholder participation in a series of workshops to determine, consecutively:
1. Consequences,
2. Top risks and locations, and
3. An action plan for adaptation.
Workshop participants include experts in the fields of transportation, economics, roadway engineering,
and communications, as well as climate change specialists, engineers for specific threats, and road asset
owners. In a first workshop, participants establish a prioritized list of climate change impacts (i.e.
threats), climate parameters, and vulnerability factors. In a second workshop, participants identify
locations with high risk profiles and map them according to risk. In a third and final workshop,
participants develop an action plan that outlines a prioritized list of strategies to address the threats.
The action plan incorporates details as to the life span of the road segments, and whether the action is
for adaptation versus regular maintenance.
By engaging stakeholders in the process, the QuickScan method increases awareness about climate
change impacts, starts team building among key players, and creates a mutual understanding of future
actions.

Vulnerability Assessment
The ROADAPT vulnerability assessment outlines a three-step process for each threat identified in the
previous risk assessment. Step one identifies factors that are a prerequisite for the threat to occur and
factors that affect the level of vulnerability. In step two, the vulnerability factors are assigned a
vulnerability score and incorporated into geographic information system (GIS) layers. In step three, the
vulnerability factors are indexed and mapped to identify areas of varying degrees of vulnerability for a
particular threat.
Selecting Adaptation Strategies
The ROADAPT Guideline for Selecting Adaptation Strategies includes guidance on identifying and
selecting appropriate adaptation strategies to address and minimize risk associated with climate change
impacts. The guideline outlines an 11-step approach that road owners can use to generate a set of
policies or best strategies across a network. The 11 steps in the method are:
1. Identify the road owners’ needs.
2. Identify the damage mechanisms, design models, and climate parameters.
3. Assess the resilience of the asset in the current situation.
4. Assess the resilience of the asset in the future situation.
5. Identify adaptation measures using the ROADAPT adaptation measures database.
6. Establish adaptation policies.
7. Assess consequences of measures using the ROADAPT adaptation measures database.
8. Select adaptation strategies.
9. Identify stakeholders to be involved.
10. Identify knowledge gaps in climate change projections, technologies and essential data.
11. Develop technology roadmaps for upcoming adaptation technologies.
The ROADAPT Guideline for Selecting Adaptation Strategies includes a database of over 500 adaptation
measures for geotechnical and drainage assets, pavements, and traffic management. The measures
cover a range of categories including planning, construction, legislation, maintenance and management,
traffic management, capacity building, monitoring, and research. The measures fall within five stages:
pro-action, prevention, preparation, response, and recovery.

Highlights from National and Agency Level Assessments
UK Department for Transport (DfT), Transport Resilience Review
In 2014, the DfT commissioned an independent review of the transport network’s ability to cope with
extreme weather. The review examined the primary challenges that prolonged adverse and extreme
weather presents to the transport industry and how the challenges are currently being addressed. The
plan assessed impacts to each transport mode, including the strategic and local road network, the
national rail infrastructure network, and airports and ports of economic and strategic importance, as well
as issues common across modes. Based on the evidence gathered, the review team developed 63
recommendations for actions to improve the resilience of the UK’s transport network, many of which are
short-term actions that can be taken immediately.
Climate Change Risks to Australia’s Coasts: A First Pass National Assessment and Climate Change Risks
to Coastal Buildings and Infrastructure- A Supplement to the First Pass National Assessment
In late 2009 the Australian Government released the first national assessment of climate change risks to
Australia’s coastal assets. The report provided an analysis of the location and number of residential
properties that are at risk of inundation from rising sea levels and erosion as a consequence of climate
change. The supplemental report provides additional data on the exposure of commercial buildings, light
industrial buildings, and transport systems (road, rail, tramways) in Australia’s coastal areas. The
assessment focuses on impacts and risks at the end of the century and provides a plausible worst case
scenario to assess risk. The results of the assessment are intended to inform dialogue on a national
approach to manage risk in the future.
Infrastructure and Climate Change Risk Assessment for Victoria
The Victorian Government commissioned a study to examine the likely impacts of climate change on
Victoria’s infrastructure, including water, power, telecommunications, transport and buildings, identify
the categories of infrastructure most at risk, and identify opportunities for adaptation (CSIRO, 2007). The
report describes a worst-case scenario for low and high climate change projections for the years 2030
and 2070. For each infrastructure category, the report outlines the likely impact of climate change on
infrastructure services (the infrastructure itself and its functions), social amenity (including health and
public response), governance and the costs of maintenance, repair, and replacement. The report also
considers several adaptation responses, including change in design standards, materials selection,
planning, and maintenance regimes.
Adapting to a changing climate: Norway’s vulnerability and the need to adapt to the impacts of
climate change
From 2008-2010, the Norwegian government conducted a study to identify the impacts of and
vulnerabilities towards climate change on Norway’s natural environmental and society, and to identify
measures to reduce vulnerabilities and increase resilience. The report, which was published in 2010,
found that while Norway has high adaptive capacity in many areas, the lack of maintenance and repair in
key infrastructures and fragmentation in the natural environment increases vulnerability towards climate
change. The study recommends three overarching principles for climate change adaptation:
•

A comprehensive approach to adaptation that assesses the effects of greenhouse gas emissions,
pollution, and the natural environment should always be taken when adaptive measures are
planned.

•

Management of the natural environment must have an ecosystem-based approach.

•

Adaptation must be integrated into regular planning processes.

Highlights from National and Agency Level Assessments (continued)
New Zealand’s National Land Transport Programme
In 2008-2009 the New Zealand Transport Agency completed Research Report 378 (Gardiner, et al. 2008,
2009), a two-stage project that identified and assessed the impacts that climate change may have on
New Zealand’s land transport network. The report provides recommendations, including adaptation
options, to address identified information gaps and risks. The Stage Two report deals with regional
effects of climate extremes on the networks, and considers how these vary by region, when and where
these risks emerge and which parts of the land transport networks are most at risk. Existing data from
infrastructure providers was used to assess the current vulnerability of networks to extreme weather.
Extrapolation was used to predict future effects based on modelling of climate extremes for 10-, 50and 100-year projections using a mid-range (A1B) scenario. Regional impacts were determined from GIS
maps by overlaying climate change predictions with transport infrastructure. Priority adaptation
responses are discussed for each national profile in the context of design, operation, research and
policy issues, and related emerging climate change research.
The New Zealand Transport Agency aims to have a national infrastructure network investment and
management approach to resilience in place by 2017 to include in the 2018-2021 three year National
Land Transport Plan (New Zealand Transport Agency, 2014). To achieve this resilience approach goal,
over the next three years the Transport Agency will complete a risk assessment to determine where
funding is required and feasible for adaptation works via the National Land Transport Plan. This
assessment will identify priority corridors and critical points and associated risk treatment work that
meet funding criteria. The Agency intends to allocate budget in the 2018-2021 National Land Transport
Plan to carry out the works identified.

4. Long Range Transportation Planning and Land Use
Incorporating climate change impacts and climate data into long range transportation planning and land
use decisions can play a significant role in both mitigating and adapting to climate change. Even though
transportation and land use decision-making often occur at the local and/or regional level, the examples
featured below, illustrate how different countries have been able to integrate climate change
considerations into national and state policies and procedures to inform and guide transportation and
land use planning processes.
United Kingdom National Road and Rail Networks National Policy Statement
The UK passed its Planning Act 2008 to improve and accelerate the process for developing major
infrastructure projects, deemed Nationally Significant Infrastructure Projects, including as roads, ports,
energy facilities, and large-scale hazardous waste infrastructure. The Act tasked the Government with
creating National Policy Statements for different types of national infrastructure development projects
(transport, energy, water, wastewater, and waste) to provide guidance on how to assess and mitigate
the impacts of large-scale projects. To date, nine National Policy Statements have been released
regarding Energy, Ports, Waste Water, and Hazardous Waste. The statements lay out the Government’s
objectives for the development of nationally significant infrastructure, and outlines information on how
the policy takes into account mitigation of and adaptation to climate change.
The Department of Transport issued a Draft National Road and Rail Networks National Policy Statement
in December 2013 and the final version of the policy will be completed soon. This policy stipulates that
applicants seeking approval for Nationally Significant Infrastructure Projects must take climate change
effects into consideration when planning the facility’s location, design, construction, and operation.
More specifically, the policy requires that for transport infrastructure that has safety critical elements,
the applicant should apply the high emissions scenario (high impact, low likelihood) to those elements
critical to the safe operation of the infrastructure (Section 4.35).
New Zealand Guidance for Local Governments
There are locations along the New Zealand’s state highway network that have been identified as being
vulnerable to sea level rise. The New Zealand Ministry for the Environment’s Coastal Hazards and
Climate Change: A Guidance Manual for Local Government in New Zealand provides best practice
information and guidance to local authorities on integrating climate change considerations, including
sea level rise, into land-use planning and decision-making processes. The Guidance Manual includes
specific recommendations for the degree of sea level rise to consider. For planning and decision
timeframes out to the 2090s, the Guidance Manual recommends:
1. a base value sea-level rise of 0.5 m relative to the 1980–1999 average be used, along with
2. an assessment of potential consequences from a range of possible higher sea-level rise values.
At the very least, all assessments should consider the consequences of a mean sea-level rise of
at least 0.8 m relative to the 1980–1999 average.
For longer planning and decision timeframes, the Guidance Manual recommends an additional
allowance for sea-level rise of 10 mm per year beyond 2100 (New Zealand Ministry for the Environment,
2008). The Ministry for Environmental has recently commenced a review and update of this guidance
manual.
See Chapter 5 for more information on how the New Zealand Transport Agency integrates this sea level
rise planning recommendation as part of transportation project design.

Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal
In the State of Victoria, Australia, land use planning and development appeals go through the Civil and
Administrative Tribunal (Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal, 2014). Historically, this tribunal has
not factored in climate change in terms of permitting decisions related to development in coastal areas.
However, in recent years, as climate change has emerged as a pressing issue especially pertaining to
planning and environmental decision-making, the Tribunal has begun to take into account climate
change impacts in reviewing development applications. In numerous decisions, the Tribunal has rejected
development applications or refused planning permits due to the potential risk and damage that would
be caused by flooding, rising sea levels, and storm surge associated with climate change (University of
Melbourne, 2010a). In other instances, the Tribunal has only allowed development to move forward if
certain conditions are met related to mitigating the impact of climate change (University of Melbourne,
2010b). While the Tribunal’s decision-making authority only applies to the State of Victoria, it has
sparked a change within Australia in terms of how climate change factors into State and local land use
and development. Additionally, permitting decisions pertaining to VicRoads planning and development,
as well as local and private transportation suppliers, could potentially be impacted by this move toward
more fully tackling climate change impacts.

5. Integration of Climate Change into Design Practices
Engineering design standards govern many aspects of a transportation system – from roadway
geometrics and bridges and structures to erosion, sediment control, and hydraulics. Design standards
are based on the amount of risk that an infrastructure owner is willing to accept for that infrastructure
to physically be damaged or fail or to fail to provide a certain level of function/service. Transportation
engineers have traditionally relied on historical records of climate, especially extreme weather events,
when designing highway systems to meet these design standards. Most transportation infrastructure is
built to last for 50 years or longer. Confronted with climate change, past conditions may not reliable
indicators of future conditions, thus potentially bringing into question whether the magnitudes of
extreme weather events based on historical records truly represent the amount of acceptable risk or, in
other words, meet the design standards that have been set at the time of design. This suggests that
climate projections/trends should inform or be incorporated into the design process to allow for
adjustment of the magnitude of the flows to meet the design standard over the actual service life of the
infrastructure, particularly in cases where the remaining service life is long and climate trends are
projected to change.
Some transportation engineers in the U.S. have been reluctant to modify designs to promote resilience
to future environmental conditions due to uncertainties in climate projections, as well as a lack of usable
climate data at the scale (i.e. local and regional level) needed to base engineering and design
requirements. Despite facing similar challenges, several international transportation agencies have
begun to integrate climate projections into design criteria and specifications for transportation
infrastructure projects. The following sections highlight best practice examples from the agencies
included in the review.
Canada’s Public Infrastructure Engineering Vulnerability Committee (PIEVC) Engineering Protocol
Since 2005, Engineers Canada has been leading a project in Canada in partnership with Natural
Resources Canada to complete a national engineering vulnerability assessment of existing and planned
public infrastructure to the impacts of climate change. One outcome of the project is a formalized
assessment procedure or tool, known as the PIEVC Engineering Protocol. The Protocol is a five step
process to analyze the engineering vulnerability of an individual infrastructure to current and future
climate parameters, such as extreme heat or rainfall. It includes an estimate of the severity of climate
impacts on the components of the infrastructure (i.e. deterioration, damage or destruction) to enable
the identification of higher risk components and the nature of the threat from the climate change
impact. This information can be used to make informed engineering judgments on what components
require adaptation as well as how to adapt them. The Protocol has been applied in 24 case studies of
infrastructure located across Canada (Engineers Canada, 2013).
Danish Road Directorate Drainage Standards
The Danish Road Directorate bases its climate predictions on the A1B scenario from the IPCC. Based on
this scenario, annual rainfall in Denmark is predicted to increase by 11 percent by 2050 and by 22
percent by 2100. In addition, the number of days experiencing more than 20mm is projected to increase
from two to five days by 2050 and seven days by 2100. The increase in precipitation levels and rates
increases the risk of floods that exceed the capacity of the drainage infrastructure.
The DRD recognizes that integrating climate considerations into the design and construction of a project
is less expensive than having to adapt a project at a later stage. As such, the agency continuously
analyzes and updates road regulations to account for the changes in climate. In addition, for a

International Practices on Climate Adaptation in Transportation | 15

considerable time now, the agency has made a standard practice of planning new roads away from
locations that have a high risk of flooding or by creating structures with higher barriers.
Current design standards require that infrastructure be built to withstand a 25-year return period for
precipitation. Under current conditions, a 25-year return period corresponds to 58 mm of rain. Analysis
by the Danish Meteorological Institute predicts that in 2100, a 25-year event will equal 74 mm of rain. At
present, this amounts to a 100-year event (see Table 1).

The agency employs a cost-benefit approach to determine the appropriate adaptation response. For
example, a number of emergency pumps are located across the country to alleviate road flooding. Based
on the Blue Spot analysis, the agency is, as an example, planning to increase the number and capacity of
pumps at road stretches particularly prone to flooding in order to ensure that roads are re-opened as
quickly as possible and that material damage is kept to a minimum.
Korea Expressway Corporation
Climate change impacts on the Korean Peninsula are expected to entail more frequent heavy rain and
typhoon events, stronger winds, greater flooding, heavier snowfall, and higher average temperatures
(Korean Meteorological Administration, 2013). The KEC is taking steps to improve its design criteria to
protect transportation infrastructure against these anticipated changes.
•

Strengthened Design Rainfall Generation Frequency: In 2000, KEC required culverts and drainage
pipes to be built to accommodate a 25-year precipitation event. Beginning in 2006, the KEC now
requires that in mountainous areas these drainage facilities be built to accommodate a 100-year
event (see Table 2).

Increased safety factor for slope stability: Safety factors for slope stability describe the structural
capacity of a system on a slope. In order to improve and strengthen slope stability, KEC has
increased the required design factor of safety from 1.1 to 1.2.

•

Improved function of drainage facilities: The KEC has made improvements to its design criteria
to improve the ability of drainage facilities to collect water. These improvements included
requiring a higher superelevation of curved sections (increased from 0 to 6 percent); increasing
the width of the collecting well (from 1.0m to 1.4m) and the diameter of the collecting ditch
(from 600 millimeters (mm) to 1,000 mm); and increasing the length of collecting ditches (from
2.4 m to 3.5 m) (see Figure 3 and Figure 4).

•

Increased concrete strength: In order to protect structures from salt damage caused by an
increased use in de-icing materials, the KEC increased the concrete protection of concrete used
on small-sized bridges. The concrete strength was increased from 24 megapascals (MPa) to over
30 MPa. This increased strength also helps to protect the structures against frost damage.

•

Employed bridge design countermeasures: Flooding has major impacts on bridges, including
overflow and inundation, scour of foundations, debris accumulation on bridge piers, and
deterioration and failures. To address an anticipated increase in flooding intensity and
frequency, the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport and KEC are employing new
hydraulic design requirements for new bridges. Starting in early 2000s, KEC required new
bridges to be designed for a 200-year return period. The agency also increased the minimum
freeboard from 1 to 2 meters. KEC has also increased bridge opening sizes and flow capacity by
raising required span lengths. Where possible, KEC has begun locating bridge piers and

International Practices on Climate Adaptation in Transportation | 17

foundations outside of main channels. The agency is also taking steps to adapt in-service bridges
at low elevation, regardless of their size, by either reconstructing them or raising their heights
by 1 to 3 meters (see Figure 5). Concrete piers and abutments are now reinforced with more
steel to ensure that the raised bridges meet the requirements for stiffness and strength.

Norwegian Public Roads Administration
In recent years, the Norwegian Public Roads Administration reviewed existing manuals that defined
agency requirements for planning, design, operation, maintenance and management of the road
network to determine necessary changes to account for climate change impacts. Examples of adaptation
measures integrated into the planning, design and construction manuals include:
•

Guidelines require 200-year flood level as design level for road elevation. Sea level rise and
increasing storm surge levels must also be taken into account (Manual N100, Road and Street
Design).

•

It is strongly recommended to plan for drainage solutions that cover a larger area and includes
alternative flood ways, retention ponds, and protective ditches on slopes and cuts.

•

A climate factor (greater than 1 but not of fixed value) has been introduced as a safety factor, in
the procedure for calculating the necessary capacity of culverts and drainage pipes. The formula
used to calculate the necessary drainage capacity (Q) is Q = C x I x A s Kf, where
C = runoff factor
i = design rainfall intensity (l/s x ha)
A = runoff area (hectare)
Kf = climate factor
The standard formula to calculate drainage includes a number of uncertainties, including
uncertainties in rainfall frequency curves and in determining the runoff factor, all of which are
enhanced by climate change. Introducing a climate factor helps to address the additional
uncertainty when calculating drainage capacity.

•

The design requirement for bridges, including design of erosion protection and free height over
water, is the 200-year flood water levels and flood loads. It is also recommended to perform a
risk analysis with respect to 1000-year flood conditions in order to avoid catastrophic

International Practices on Climate Adaptation in Transportation | 18

consequences, such as loss of life or loss of the
entire structure.
•

Climate change aspects have been included in the
model used for comparing landslide risk for roads
and prioritizing protections measures. In addition,
three new guidelines have been published that
reflect climate change risks: for protections
against rock fall, for managing snow avalanches,
and for “wet” landslides, i.e. slush avalanches and
debris flow.

UK Department for Transport
The UK Department for Transport’s Highway Agency is
moving away from relying solely on historical weather for
design considerations and is beginning to integrate
climate change considerations into its design standards.
For example, the Highway Agency has adopted the Enrobé
à Module Élevé Class 2 (EME2) pavement standard where
appropriate. EME2, which is based on French practice, has
a higher cost but it is more resilient to high loads under
higher temperatures.
The Highway Agency also addressed climate change
impacts in recent revisions to highway drainage standards
in its Design Manual for Roads and Bridges (HD 33 and HD
45). The design manual includes the following guidance
regarding detailed design of pavement drainage:
Allowance for climate change: The rainfall
intensities used to calculate the design storms
must include an allowance for the effects of
climate change. Where rainfall data exclude such
an allowance, a sensitivity test on the design of
the drainage system must be carried out by
increasing rainfall intensities of the design storm
by 20 percent.
As part of the next iteration of drainage standards, the
agency is considering an allowance for a 30 percent
increase in rainfall intensities of the design storm. This
demonstrates the agency’s commitment to ensuring that
its infrastructure is able to withstand the changing climate
over its expected lifetime.

Project Case Study:
High Speed Two (HS2)
H2S is the UK Government’s proposal for
a new, high speed north-south railway
that will connect London to Leeds and
beyond. As part of the environmental
impact assessment for the project, the
project sponsor conducted a high level
climate change risk and resilience
assessment to identify the potential
risks of climate change on the proposed
project. The assessment considered
climate-related hazards such as extreme
hot and cold weather, heavy rain, high
winds, and storms posed to the
infrastructure and assets associated with
the proposed project. The assessment
identified two high risk areas: (1) flood
of track work, cuttings and tunnels, and
(2) overheating in tunnels. To mitigate
these risks, the project design
incorporated resilience design
measures. To address the potential risk
of flooding, all operational infrastructure
and assets are protected by a one meter
freeboard above the 1 in 1,000 year (0.1
percent) annual probability of flooding.
The one meter freeboard provides
increased protection to allow for flood
risk modeling uncertainty. In addition,
the railway drainage will be designed to
accommodate storms up to the 1 in 100
year (1 percent) annual probability of
flooding , including an increase of 30
percent for climate change allowance
(Department for Transport, 2013).

New Zealand Transport Agency
As previously highlighted, the New Zealand Ministry for the Environment recommends specific sea level
rise values that agencies should consider as part of the planning process. The New Zealand Transport
Agency incorporated this sea level rise planning recommendation as part of the design for the SH16
Causeway Upgrade Project. The Causeway is a key part of the Western Ring Route – one of the country’s

International Practices on Climate Adaptation in Transportation | 19

seven roads of national significance. As part of the project the Causeway is being raised to reduce
flooding during extreme tidal conditions (see Figure 6).
Figure 6: Causeway Upgrade Project Construction. Top Image: Existing Causeway Configuration in 2013.
Bottom Image: Final Causeway Configuration by 2017.

The New Zealand Transport Agency’s Bridge Manual (3rd Edition) also requires consideration of climate
change impacts in the design of bridges and culverts. Specifically, the manual states:
Design for climate change effects: Where it is practical and economic for a bridge or culvert
structure to be retrofitted at a later date to accommodate increased flood flows arising from the
effects of climate change, the structure need not initially be designed to accommodate
increased flood flows arising from the effects of climate change. Where future retrofitting is not
practical or does not reflect value for money, future climate change impacts shall be taken into
account in the design.
Finally, the New Zealand Transport Agency’s state highway environmental plan (2008) includes an
objective to manage increased hazards of climate change impacts on state highway infrastructure. The
plan states that “in factoring in climate change adaptation into design, consider the following:
•

the intended design life of the infrastructure and whether climate change impacts may
manifest within the intended design life; and

•

whether future-proofing the design is required so later retro-fit is feasible and cost-effective.

6. Maintenance and Operations
Climate change impacts will likely necessitate changes in the ways transportation agencies operate and
maintain their systems and facilities. Some of the agencies participating in the review are making minor
changes to maintenance and operation activities, though most indicated that they are not at the point
where climate change impacts have directly translated to changes in their maintenance practices.
However, nearly all interviewees believed that such changes – conducting more frequent maintenance
of pavement, for example – would likely occur.
The following is a summary of the changes to maintenance and operation activities that the countries
included in the review have already made as a result of changes in climate.
Increased field inspection of drainage systems
Several agencies, including the DRD, UK Highways Agency, and New Zealand Transport Agency, noted an
increased emphasis on the need to inspect and improve drainage systems to ensure that they are being
maintained properly and meet the appropriate levels of service. The need for increased field inspection
and maintenance of drainage systems is particularly important for areas that are potentially vulnerable
to flooding. It is vital for such systems to run at optimal levels to mitigate any flooding that may be
associated with increased precipitation levels or higher intensity precipitation events.
Provision of traveler information to address weather-related safety
Several agencies have expanded efforts to provide travelers with better information in order to
minimize weather-related traffic incidents. The DRD for example operates and maintains a road-user
information center that, through collaboration with the Danish Meteorological Institute, provides
information about flooding through its traffic information services, including its website and mobile
telephone applications. The agency also coordinates with Danmarks Radio, the country’s national
broadcasting corporation to provide information on road mobility problems, including those caused by
flooding. Similarly, the KEC has increased efforts to provide traveler information. In 2010, Korea’s
Meteorological Administration launched Weavigation, which provides drivers with weather forecast
information at their current location, destination, and for the route to the destination. The information
is sent directly to drivers’ navigation systems, social network services, and variable message signs.
Weather data such as precipitation, temperature, humidity, road surface temperature, and wind speed
and direction is collected and updated every minute from roadside weather sensors. In addition, current
weather, weather forecast, severe weather alerts, and interactive radar images are also sent to drivers.
Drivers can refer to the service when they choose and change their own paths; however the information
is not fully integrated into automatic route guidance.
Installation of Traffic Safety and Warning Measures
The KEC has enhanced traffic safety measures to adapt to changes in climate conditions. In recent years,
Korea has experienced an increase in the occurrence of severe, localized winds and an increase in the
intensity of typhoons. To minimize safety impacts to motorists, the KEC has implemented speed limit
restrictions or full closures on long-span bridges under strong wind conditions (i.e. when 10-minute
average wind speed measured using anemometers on the bridge is above 25 m/s, the bridges are closed
to traffic). The agency has also installed mesh wind screens on smaller-scale bridges in order to reduce
the velocity of crosswinds. Road management agencies in Korea are also monitoring vulnerable slopes
for avalanches and land/mudslides in real time through closed caption televisions or sensors installed on
the slopes. These warning systems automatically notify the appropriate experts at the responsible
agencies via mobile phone.

International Practices on Climate Adaptation in Transportation | 21

Improved Emergency Plans
The Norwegian Public Roads Administration developed a system for “stepwise preparedness” for
readiness against avalanches, floods, and other natural hazards. The agency uses the system to outline
recommended preparedness levels during challenging weather situations. Specific tasks and
responsibilities are outlined for the four preparedness levels: green, yellow, orange, and red.
The Public Roads Agency, in collaboration with the Norwegian National Rail Administration, Norwegian
Water Resources and Energy Directorate, and the Meteorological Institute, developed a web portal tool
– www.xgeo.no – to assist with preparedness, monitoring, and forecasting of floods, landslides, and
avalanches. XGEO is a map centric tool for visualizing temporal and spatial data from various data
sources. The tool shows historical daily maps of the snow conditions, interpolated weather observations
and numerical predictions (which are based on European atmospheric models), gridded water balance,
and climate means and anomalies. It also includes data from real-time weather point observations from
300 weather stations as well as webcams. The tool also provides access to real-time observations of
avalanches, including observations from professional avalanche observers, public observers, and
observers from the rail and road authorities (see Figure 7)(specific information about each avalanche or
flood incident through a separate registration system). The weather and climate data is overlaid on
administrative data, such as rail and road infrastructure.
Figure 7: XGEO Web Tool

Map depicting avalanche activity for the past 200 days in a subarea of Norway.

The Norwegian Public Roads Administration has also developed an improved template for emergency
plans for natural hazards, which it is integrating into all operation contracts. The plan includes more
elaborate use of weather data and map-based information concerning flood and landslides for the
specific area of road that the contractor is responsible for maintaining. By providing more detailed
information the agency hopes to encourage proactive management, such as prioritizing culverts to clean
in advance of anticipated heavy rain, in order to mitigate issues.

International Practices on Climate Adaptation in Transportation | 22

7. Asset Management
Transportation asset management is a strategic and systematic approach to effectively managing
transportation infrastructure through its life cycle. It focuses on business and engineering practices for
resource allocation and utilization, with the objective of better decisionmaking based upon quality
information and well-defined objectives.
Climate change impacts will likely affect transportation asset management investment cycles. The
following section highlights examples on how transportation agencies are actively integrating climate
change considerations into their asset management plans.
Korea Expressway Corporation Risk-Based Slope Management
The KEC manages approximately 8,400 slopes (cut-slopes higher than 5 meters) across its roadway
network. Each year the country experiences casualties and property damage due to slope failures and
debris flow caused by typhoons and heavy rain events. The KEC inspects approximately three percent of
these slopes annually through its general inspection process, programming funding for slope
maintenance activities based on the results of the inspection and evaluation. However, the agency has
found that in extreme weather events related to climate change, damages have occurred on nontargeted slopes. As a result the agency has had to invest funding in emergency relief to restore these
damaged slopes rather than perform maintenance activities on the programmed slopes. Since the
agency does not have the capacity and financial resources to inspect all slopes simultaneously, it has
focused on early detection and preventive maintenance to reduce risk and damage caused by slope
failures.
In 2011, the KEC instituted a new preventive slope management strategy in order to reduce the amount
of money spent on emergency relief. As part of this strategy, the KEC now performs basic and in-depth
surveys and prioritizes investments in a five-year cycle. In order to prioritize slopes for preventative
maintenance, the agency conducts a debris flow risk assessment process. The debris flow risk
assessment process involves four steps:
•

Risk assessment scope definitions – identify the risk location and risk area

•

Hazard analysis – identify risks based on the hydrologic and geologic character of the region and
the damage range

•

Consequence analysis – analyze the facilities affected and vulnerabilities

•

Risk assessment – conduct both a qualitative and quantitative evaluation based on hazard and
consequence

The risk assessment results in a score from 0–30 and a corresponding risk grade of S, A, B, C, D, and E
that is based on the likelihood of damage occurring during different rainfall frequency events. A risk
grade of “S,” for example, is defined as damage that may occur in a 2–5 year rainfall event; whereas a
risk of grade of “D” is defined as damage that may occur in a 1,000-year rainfall event. The risk
assessment helps to inform design considerations for risk mitigation and asset management decisions.
The KEC is also developing an accountable, reliable database of the effectiveness of preventative slope
management activities to help ensure the quality of preventive investment decisions.
New Zealand’s Coastal Effects Assessment Guideline
The New Zealand Transport Agency manages its state highway infrastructure in accordance with the

International Practices on Climate Adaptation in Transportation | 23

State Highway Asset Management Plan (NZTA, 2014), which requires assets to be regularly checked for
dependability to ensure they perform as required. The Asset Management Plan also discusses risk to the
networks and its impact on customer service and transport efficiency including long term issues such as
climate change effects.
To assist staff with assessing infrastructures’ existing and future dependability, the Transport Agency
developed a draft Coastal Effects Assessment Guideline, outlining a simple and consistent process for
asset managers to determine short- and long-term risks to state highway assets in the coastal
environment. The Guide provides a systematic way to collect information on risks to assets and the
surrounding coastal environment, both short- (up to 10 years) and long-term (50–100 years), and
considers these across a section of the network, rather than at individual locations. By taking a
comprehensive approach to assess and record coastal environmental risks management,4 approaches
can be adapted to differing scenarios and consider wider issues than just the structural integrity of an
asset (Grieg, et al 2014).The Guide also emphasizes making decisions on what work to prioritize based
on the magnitude of the risk, and provides documentation to support a business case for the actions
identified, which is required for all Agency projects to be approved and funded. The Transport Agency is
currently testing the Guide in determine its usefulness in real-world settings before refining and
finalizing it.
The New Zealand Transport Agency is also working with regional councils who have taken an active role
in looking at regional risk issues and consequences. Joint approaches that are inclusive of major
stakeholders are aimed at improving overall resilience of regional networks focused on an
understanding of past and recent events and looking forward at climate change effects.

8. Research
Many of the transportation agencies included in the review are participating in collaborative research
initiatives that address critical information and data needs related to climate change adaptation. The
following section showcases these research initiatives.
ERA-NET Road
Since 2006, the European Road Administrations have shared their road research priorities and budgets
to organize transnational research programs that cover a range of topics. In 2008, the Conference for
European Directors of Roads (CEDR) initiated ERA-NET ROAD, its first cross-border funded research
program. The National Road Administrations in the following 11 countries funded the program: Austria,
Denmark, Finland, Germany, Ireland, The Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Spain, Sweden, and the UK. The
goal of the research program, titled “Road Owners Getting to Grips with Climate Change,” was to
provide European road authorities with the knowledge and tools necessary to "get to grips" with
climate change and its effects on all elements of road management by adapting design rules,
updating and improving data collection, and developing risk management methods. The 2008
program funded four research projects (see below). Information about each of the four projects,
including a summary of results and implementation strategies, is available in the Final Report of ERANET ROAD Programme “Road Owners Getting to Grips with Climate Change:
•

IRWIN - Improved local winter index to assess maintenance needs and adaptation costs in
climate change scenarios: The main objective of IRWIN is to develop an improved local road
winter index, which is sufficiently detailed and comprehensive so that road authorities and
owners can use it to assess the implications of future scenarios and climate change implications,
and perform reliable cost/benefit analyses. The project collected ten years of observations from
50 road weather stations in Sweden and 49 stations in Finland. Maintenance actions from the
regions of interest were available as well, and were used in the final winter index calculations.
The resulting IRWIN observational database provides a better understanding of local weather
variations and a clearer representation of weather and climate of the road network.

•

P2R2C2 - Pavement Performance & Remediation Requirements following Climate Change: The
P2R2C2 project investigated the likely impacts of climate change in Europe, from the Alps and
northwards, on the moisture/ice conditions in the pavement and the subgrade, and the
consequential pavement material behavior and pavement response to traffic over a 100-year
timescale. The project found that the life cycle of the pavement is much less than the time span
over which climate change will have a statistically dependable influence on pavement
performance. At present, road designers only need to change their practice for the pavements
with the longest life or for the lower layers that may not be touched during future rehabilitation
and reconstruction. The appropriate responses to these changes in pavement performance will
be achievable, in most cases, by routine material formulations that can be employed at the next
reconstruction/rehabilitation event. However, some responses will require engineers to develop
new design criteria regarding temperature and return period of storm flows (regionally specific)
and to pay more attention to drainage systems, particularly to make them self-cleaning and
easily inspectible. In addition, actions to improve future pavement performance will likely
include stabilization of unsealed pavements, overlaying by bound layers or operational
management solutions based on continuously monitored condition,

•

RIMAROCC - Risk Management for Roads in a Changing Climate: The RIMAROCC method is a risk
management-based framework or decision support for road owners dealing with climate

International Practices on Climate Adaptation in Transportation | 25

change. The project developed the RIMAROCC framework to facilitate the production of a Risk
Management Study by or for a road authority. The method can be used to mitigate threats,
reduce vulnerabilities and minimize the consequences of an event. The RIMAROCC Framework
consists of seven steps each with a number of sub-steps:
1. Context Analysis
2. Risk Identification
3. Risk Analysis
4. Risk Evaluation
5. Risk mitigation
6. Implementation of an Action Plan
7. Monitoring, Review & Capitalization
•

SWAMP - Storm Water prevention–Methods to predict damage from water stream in and near
road pavements in lowland area: The SWAMP project addresses the critical issue of finding the
parts of the road network that are most vulnerable to flooding, using GIS as a basis. The project
developed the Blue Spot concept: a chain of procedures that can be used by road owners,
operators or consultants to systematically analyze, adapt and protect the road network with
respect to flooding (see Chapter 3 for more details on applying the Blue Spot concept). The
project also identified the crucial issues to consider when creating national or even regional
guidelines for inspections and maintenance of Blue Spots.

CEDR Research Program
In 2012, CEDR (European Road Directors organization) initiated a second call that built upon the first
ERANET call for a research program on climate change. The second call focused on providing owners
with adaptation technologies and the models and tools to support decisionmaking concerning
adaptation measures for road infrastructure. The climate change research program was funded by
Denmark, Germany, Norway, and the Netherlands. The program call resulted in two projects, which are
currently underway:
•

ROADAPT: Roads for Today, Adapted for Tomorrow: The ROADAPT project, which was
highlighted in previous chapters, provides integrated, more detailed, and hands-on methods
and tools to be used within the RIMAROCC framework in a transnational setting (see Chapter 3
for more details on the ROADAPT project).

•

ClipDaR: Design guideline for a transnational database of downscaled Climate Projection Data
for Road impact models: The project will focus on the review, analysis, and assessment of
existing regional Climate Change projections regarding transnational highway networks needs.

Infrastructure Slopes – Sustainable Management and Resilience Assessment
The UK Highways Agency is partnering with academic institutions, infrastructure owners, and
engineering companies on the Infrastructure Slopes – Sustainable Management and Resilience
Assessment (iSMART) project. The purpose of the project is to create a visualized model of transient
water movement in infrastructure slopes under a range of current and future environmental scenarios
based on a fundamental understanding of earthwork material and system behavior (Engineering and
Physical Sciences Research Council, 2014). The results of the study will provide decision-makers with a
better understanding of the interactions between earthwork, vegetation, and climate, which is needed

in order to develop robust guidance on which maintenance approaches should be adopted and how
they should be applied.
Transport Canada’s Northern Transportation Adaptation Initiative
Transport Canada's Northern Transportation Adaptation Initiative is designed to improve understanding
of climate impacts and facilitate better and more integrated transportation planning and adaptation
measures. As part of the Initiative, Transport Canada provides funding support to territorial
governments and non-profit organizations to conduct research and development activities related to
the design, development, and adoption of innovative technologies and best practices. This work will
help make existing and future northern transportation infrastructure and operations more resilient and
adaptable to climate change. To support the delivery of the research and development activities, two
networks for experts from government, academia, and the private sector were established: the
Permafrost Network and the Network of Expertise on Transportation in Arctic Waters.

9. Conclusions
The activities of the international transportation agencies included in this review offer valuable insights
into how to transportation agencies globally are beginning to adapt infrastructure to anticipated climate
change impacts. While the geographic, environmental, and societal conditions of the agencies in the
review may differ in some ways to those of transportation agencies in the United States, they face many
of the same challenges. For all agencies, the cost of adapting the transportation network to climate
change is much greater than the funding currently available for adaptation. Additionally, each agency
faces similar uncertainties in terms of climate models, unknown future carbon emission levels, and the
timing and extent of anticipated impacts. However, the transportation agencies included in the review
are taking proactive actions to address the inherent uncertainties and manage the associated risks.
Many of the agencies have established formal strategic frameworks for addressing climate change
adaptation and have identified processes to address and respond to these risks. The most proactive
agencies have comprehensively examined the risks and vulnerabilities of the transportation network to
climate change impacts and are employing systematic methods to identify and prioritize measures to
maximize their effectiveness while minimizing costs.
Several agencies have also begun to employ specific adaptation measures, particularly in terms of
integrating climate change considerations into the planning and design of projects. Those agencies that
are modifying design practices acknowledge that in some cases it is more economically responsible to
climate proof infrastructure during the construction phase than to adapt in the future during the
operational phase. Changes to the planning and design of projects are primarily associated with
drainage systems, bridges, and culverts. Some of the agencies included in the review referenced using
passive adaptation options that use the natural environment to protect transportation infrastructure,
such as through protecting wetlands, barrier islands, or other natural features. However, while the
transportation agencies recognize that climate change impacts will have implications on maintenance
and operations, few are making changes in maintenance practices at this point in time.

Appendix A: Discussion Topics
1. Evolution of Policy: Overview of how your agency has reached where it is today with respect to
climate adaptation planning or action. What laws, regulations, or policies guide or influence
your work on climate change? How has climate change influenced the allocation of funds in your
agency?
2. Climate Data: Where do your climate projections come from and how do you translate this
information into a level of detail that is usable by transportation engineers and planners? For
which variables do you have useful projections and which not?
3. Uncertainty: How do you deal with the multiple layers of uncertainty inherent in adapting to
climate change (uncertainties regarding emissions levels, climate sensitivity, timing and extent
of impacts, effectiveness of adaptation strategies, future demographic and economic conditions,
etc.)? In the United States, we have found that engineers are sometimes reluctant to change the
design process because of uncertainties in climate projections, a lack of usable data at the scale
they need, and the fact that assets are already engineered to withstand extreme events. How
have you dealt with this?
4. Integration of Climate Data into Design: Please provide examples of how you have integrated
climate projections into design criteria and specifications of specific transportation
infrastructure projects.
5. Costs and Benefits: Have you analyzed the costs and benefits of particular adaptation options at
the project level and can you provide examples? Please describe any tools you have used for this
process.
6. Ecosystem Services: What opportunities have you found to build in adaptation options that use
the natural environment to protect the transportation facility, such as through protecting
wetlands, barrier islands, or other natural features?
7. Long Range Transportation Planning and Land Use: How have you incorporated climate data
into long range transportation planning and land use decisions?
8. Operations and Maintenance: Are you maintaining your transportation systems differently due
to changes in climate or do you plan to do so in the future?
9. Asset Management: If you have an asset management system, are climate change impacts
considered with regard to asset management investment cycles and if so, how?
10. Research, Training, and Communication: Are you funding or conducting any research or training
on improving the resilience of transportation to climate change? If so, please describe. Is there
recognition among the public, senior officials, and staff of the need for climate adaptation? How
do you communicate with internal and external stakeholders regarding climate adaptation?

Appendix B: Agency Snapshots
VicRoads, Victoria, Australia
Agency Overview: VicRoads is an agency under
the Department of Transport, Planning and
Local Infrastructure within the State
Government of Victoria. VicRoads plans,
develops, and manages over
22,000 kilometers (km) of roads (including
freeways, highways, major arterials),
approximately 3,200 bridges, and more than
4,500 other structures. The roads, which
amount to approximately 20 percent of those
in Victoria, carry 80 percent of the State’s
traffic.
Projected Climate Impacts for Victoria: Victoria is
a coastal state with diverse environmental
regions, including wet, temperate climates
and semi-arid plains. The anticipated climate
change impacts in Victoria are: higher
temperature; increase in the number and
intensity of hot days (over 95⁰); decrease in
average number of frost days; decrease in
annual average rainfall by 4% by 2030; an
increase risk of drought, and increase in
heavy rainfall intensity in the summer and fall
(Victorian Government Department of
Sustainability and Environment, 2008). Under
most scenarios, projected sea level rise by
2030 for Victoria is approximately 0.2 meters
(m). By 2100, projected sea level rise ranges
from 0.8 m and 1.4 m. (Sinclair Knight Merz,
2012).
New Zealand Transport Agency, New Zealand
Agency Overview: The New Zealand Transport
Agency manages nearly 11,000 km of
highways in New Zealand. The Agency’s state
highways carry 50 percent of traffic vehicle
miles and 75 percent of heavy traffic vehicle
miles traveled, and provide vital connections
to much of New Zealand’s 83,000 km of local
roadways. NZTA also runs the Roads of
National Significance Programme, which
focuses on reducing congestion, improving
safety, and spurring economic growth
through the implementation of seven major

infrastructure projects within or adjacent to
New Zealand’s five major population centers.
Projected Climate Impacts for New Zealand: New
Zealand anticipate the following changes as a
result of climate change: higher
temperatures; rising sea levels; more
frequent extreme weather events such as
droughts and floods; a change in rainfall
patterns; an increase in the intensity of
severe storms; and, an increase in storm
surge levels (New Zealand Ministry for the
Environment).
Vejdirektoratet (Danish Road Directorate),
Denmark
Agency Overview: The Danish Road Directorate
(DRD) oversees approximately 3,800 km of
highway and main state roads. These roads
account for approximately 5 percent of the
total road network in Denmark in length, but
control 50 percent of the total traffic.
Projected Climate Impacts for Denmark: The DRD
bases its future projections on climate
scenario A1B from the Intergovernmental
Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The Danish
government recently released guidance that
all government levels use this scenario to
make climate projections. The A1B model is
corrected for local effects using models from
the Danish Metrological Institute. One of the
primary anticipated changes from climate
change in Denmark is increased rainfall. The
A1B scenario predicts that annual rainfall will
increase 11 percent by 2050 and 22 percent
by 2100. Also, the number of days with
precipitation greater than 20mm is projected
to increase to more than 4 days by 2030, 5
days by 2015, and 7 days by 2100.
Rijkswaterstaat (Transportation and Water
Infrastructure Agency), Netherlands
Agency Overview: Rijkswaterstaat is part of the
Dutch Ministry of Infrastructure and the
Environment. It is responsible for the design,

International Practices on Climate Adaptation in Transportation | 30

construction, management, and maintenance
of the main infrastructure facilities in the
Netherlands. In this, Rijkswaterstaat aims at a
good balance between economy,
environment and quality of life.
Rijkswaterstaat responsibilities include the
main road network, the main waterway
network, and the main water systems. The
main road network includes 3,046 km of
motorways, 1,428 km of access and
connecting roads, 2,749 viaducts, 22 tunnels,
and 743 bridges.
Projected Climate Impacts for The Netherlands:
The Netherlands anticipates more storms and
heavier rainfall due to global climate change.
The country also projects sea level rise
between 20 centimeters (cm) and 85 cm by
2100.
Korea Expressway Corporation (KEC), Korea
Agency Overview: KEC, one of Korea's major
government-invested corporations, is a
competent authority for national expressway
system in Korea. KEC currently manages
3,790km of expressway network.
Projected Climate Impacts for Korea: Based on
Korean Meteorological Administration’s
reports on climate change, climate change
will have a variety of impacts on the Korean
Peninsula, including an increase in
temperature, a reduction of winter period, an
increase in extreme typhoons, heavier
snowfall, and an increase in heavy rainfall.
Annual precipitation days are projected to
decrease, whereas the annual number of
heavy rain days and the amount of rainfall is
projected to increase.
Department for Transport and Highways Agency,
United Kingdom (UK)
Agency Overview: The UK Department for
Transport is a ministerial department,
supported by 21 agencies and public bodies
that include all modes of transportation. The
Department is responsible for providing
policy, guidance, and funding to English local
authorities to help them run and maintain
their road networks, improve passenger and

freight travel, and develop new major
transport schemes. The agency also sets the
strategic direction for the rail industry and the
ports and establishes national aviation policy.
The Highways Agency, which is under the
Department for Transport, is responsible for
the trunk roads and major strategic routes in
England. These roads represent less than 3
percent of the country’s total roadways, but
carry the vast majority of traffic (a third of all
traffic and two thirds of all UK freight).
Projected Climate Impacts of the UK: The UK’s
Met Office produces probabilistic climate
change projections for the country. The most
recent information, the UK Climate
Projections (UKCP09), predicts increased
temperatures for all areas of the UK, an
increase in the number of days with high
temperatures, a reduction in the number of
frost days, an increase in the amount of
winter rainfall, and a decrease in summer
precipitation. Sea level rise is projected to be
between 12 and 76 cm for the period 1990–
2095. Sea level rise coupled with more
frequent storm surges may increase flood risk
(United Kingdom Highways Agency, 2009).
Statens vegvesen (Public Roads Administration),
Norway
Agency Overview: The Norwegian Public Roads
Administration plans, builds, operates, and
maintains national and county roads in
Norway. The road network includes 10,446km
of national roads and 44,333km of county
roads.
Projected Climate Impacts for Norway: Projections
for Norway show that the climate can be
expected to change considerably: mean
temperature will increase; sea level could rise
between 500-100cm; and storm surges will
increase correspondingly. The average annual
precipitation in Norway is expected to
increase, and more days with heavy
precipitation and higher average amounts of
precipitation are also expected during all
seasons (Norwegian Ministry of the
Environment, 2010).

Transport Canada, Canada
Agency Overview: Transport Canada has
jurisdiction over aviation and marine
transportation, major railways, and
interprovincial and international bridges and
tunnels. Canadian provinces and territories
have jurisdiction over intraprovincial
transportation, including roads and bridges.
Projected Climate Impacts for Canada: Canada has
experienced increases in temperatures and
annual precipitation. The frequency and
severity of extreme weather events, such as
heat waves, droughts, and floods, will
increase as a result of climate change. The
country also anticipates reduced Artic ice
cover and loss of permafrost. Climate changerelated risks to coastal areas in Canada
include coastal inundation, increased stormsurge flooding, and shoreline erosion
(Government of Canada, 2014).

PROGRAM: OUTCOMES, LESSONS LEARNED, AND
RECOMMENDATIONS
JULY 2016

Forward
State and regional transportation agencies across the country are facing an increase in extreme
weather events that damage roads, bridges and other transportation facilities. Heat waves,
drought, storm surges and heavy downpours are becoming more frequent and severe. Sea level
rise that is already affecting coastal assets and communities today will accelerate in the future.
These climate change and extreme weather events pose significant risks to the safety,
reliability, effectiveness, and sustainability of the Nation’s transportation system.
Over the course of two years, FHWA worked with State Departments of transportation (DOTs)
and metropolitan planning organizations (MPOs) to undertake 19 assessments of climate
change and extreme weather vulnerability and adaptation options on their transportation
systems. The pilots used and built on FHWA’s Climate Change and Extreme Weather
Vulnerability Assessment Framework. This report highlights results and lessons learned from
those efforts and will be helpful for others conducting climate change vulnerability
assessments. We will fold these lessons learned into an updated Climate Change Resilience
Framework. The audience for this report includes transportation planners, asset managers, civil
engineers, and others interested in assessing and addressing resilience of transportation
systems. More information on climate resilience can be found on the FHWA website at:
http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/environment/climate_change/adaptation/.

13. ABSTRACT (Maximum 200 words)
The Federal Highway Administration’s (FHWA)’s Climate Resilience Pilot Program sought to assist state Departments of
Transportation (DOTs), Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPOs), and Federal Land Management Agencies (FLMAs)
in enhancing resilience of transportation systems to extreme weather and climate change. From 2013 to 2015,
nineteen pilot teams partnered with FHWA to assess transportation vulnerability and evaluate options for improving
resilience. This report synthesizes lessons learned, needs identified, and recommended next steps from the pilot
program. Illustrative project findings, outcomes, and examples are distributed throughout the report.

Executive Summary

Introduction to the Program
The Federal Highway Administration’s (FHWA)’s Climate Resilience Pilot Program sought to
assist state Departments of Transportation (DOTs), Metropolitan Planning Organizations
(MPOs), and Federal Land Management Agencies (FLMAs) in enhancing resilience of
transportation systems to extreme weather and climate change. From 2013 to 2015, nineteen
pilot teams partnered with FHWA to assess transportation vulnerability and evaluate options
for improving resilience.
Key Program Outcomes
The pilot program helped build a community of practice for transportation agencies seeking to
increase resilience to weather extremes. The pilots participated in peer exchanges and,
collectively, have developed a wealth of best practices and examples for every stage of the
adaptation process, including: collecting and applying climate change projections; identifying
critical assets; assessing vulnerabilities and risks; calculating costs and benefits of adaptation;
and incorporating risks into decision-making.
The pilot teams are now more prepared to address climate change and extreme weather risks.
They have built capacity among staff to understand the challenge of climate change. Pilots
have developed replicable processes to expand vulnerability or cost-benefit analyses, where
applicable. Pilot teams are also integrating their findings into decision making by incorporating
climate change into engineering design, long range planning, and asset management.
This report synthesizes lessons learned, needs identified, and recommended next steps from
the pilot program. Illustrative project findings, outcomes, and examples are distributed
throughout the report.

decision-making. Several pilot teams identified and evaluated adaptation options, testing
approaches that: utilized existing adaptation tools, processes, and datasets; used adaptation
evaluation criteria that reflect priorities of local stakeholders; analyzed costs and benefits; and
engaged stakeholders to vet adaptation options.
In testing these approaches, the pilots faced and overcame several challenges related to
defining the scope of their projects, data collection and processing, coordination with partners
and stakeholders, and obtaining verification of assessment results.

Needs
The pilots have made significant advances in the “state of the practice” of adapting
transportation systems to climate change. In the process, they identified several needs for
additional information and resources. For example, pilot teams identified the need for more
information, guidance, and tools to support climate analysis, benefit cost assessments, and
integration of vulnerability assessment results and adaptation into transportation planning.
The pilots have already begun to address some of these needs. For example, NYSDOT
developed a benefits valuation approach to help decision makers prioritize infrastructure and
assess when to undertake culvert replacements considering social, economic, and
environmental factors.
Pilot Recommendations for FHWA
The pilots provided recommendations for how FHWA can continue to support state and local
transportation agencies as they attempt to increase their resilience to extreme weather events
and climate change. Recommendations included:

The Federal Highway Administration’s (FHWA)’s Climate Resilience Pilot Program seeks to assist
state Departments of Transportation (DOTs), Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPOs), and
Federal Land Management Agencies (FLMAs) in enhancing resilience of transportation systems
to extreme weather and climate change. In 2010-2011, five pilot teams from across the country
participated in the program to advance the practice of climate change and extreme weather
vulnerability assessments for transportation. In 2013-2015, nineteen pilot teams (see Figure 1)
partnered with FHWA to assess transportation vulnerability and evaluate options for improving
resilience, including:

FHWA’s Climate Change & Extreme Weather
Vulnerability Assessment Framework was an
important element of the program. The 20102011 pilot teams tested a conceptual model that
guided transportation agencies through the
process of collecting and integrating climate and
asset data in order to identify critical
vulnerabilities. FHWA used the feedback and
lessons learned from the first round of pilots to
revise the draft conceptual model into the
framework. The 2013-2015 pilot teams utilized
the framework and continued to identify lessons
learned regarding vulnerability assessments and
evaluation of adaptation options.

requested that MassDOT expand their modeling analysis to cover the entire state. The pilot
teams and program disseminated lessons learned via webinars, speaking engagements, printed
case studies, and online resources.

To evaluate future flood conditions, the Iowa DOT

projections of rainfall within a river system model to
predict river flood response to climate change. Iowa
DOT tested this methodology in two river basins to
evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of technology
to produce scenarios of future flood conditions. They

their latest LRTP. At the conclusion of the study, CAMPO
and the City of Austin hosted an inaugural Extreme Weather
Resiliency Symposium with agencies from around the
region, and intend to form a multi-agency working group to
build on the momentum of this project.
The CTDOT team found that most structures were built with
excess capacity and will therefore be able to accommodate
future increases in precipitation. Moving forward, CTDOT
recommended that all new infrastructure be designed using
the precipitation data from the NRCC-NRCS “Precip.net”
until the new NOAA Atlas 14 data were available. Before
this study, CTDOT was still using TP-40 for their designs
which hadn’t been updated since 1961.
Hillsborough MPO devoted a chapter within its Long Range
Transportation Plan (LRTP) to discuss the results of this
analysis. One of the assets identified as critical in the study
was scheduled for reconstruction in the MPO’s LRTP and the
MPO found that adaptation measures could be
incorporated cost-effectively during reconstruction. For
example, a $4.2 million investment to mitigate flood risk for
Memorial Highway would result in a net benefit of $2.1-$8.4
million if it experienced a Category 1 storm surge (and
higher benefits for a stronger storm).
Iowa DOT determined that the leading edge of downscaled
climate projection data resolution (one-eighth degree and
daily increments) was sufficient for simulating peak flow
statistics of “Big Basins and Big Floods,” quantitatively
defined as basins exceeding 100 square miles with floods
exceeding twice the mean annual peak flow. This modeling
was used to confirm that a new bridge project on I-35 will

The analysis found that the majority of damage would be

identified the design option with the lowest total life cycle
cost under each sea level rise scenario. In general, smaller
structures that required lower or moderate initial
construction costs tended to be more cost-efficient.
The sea level rise mapping results have been integrated into
the project screening process. Additionally, MDSHA is using
the results in their regional planning processes, such as

The project team used the model to develop a series of
projected water surface elevations for hurricanes and
nor’easters. Using a Monte Carlo approach, the team was
able to estimate the probability of flooding on a highresolution grid under current and two future sea level rise
scenarios, and to assess flood entry points and pathways
(and thereby identify potential locations for regional
adaptation strategies). In many cases, large upland areas are
flooded by a relatively small and distinct entry point (e.g., a
low elevation area along the coastline).
The assessment found that the most at-risk transportation

operations and maintenance challenges. The analysis also
revealed that additional data on elevation, flood plains, and

assessment of asset vulnerability.
MnDOT plans to incorporate the identified risks into culvert
and bridge improvement programs, asset management
databases, the asset management plan, and MnDOT’s risk
registers. This information may feed into the development
of emergency action plans, real-time monitoring and
warning systems for vulnerable assets, and the prioritization
of funding for cost-effective adaptation strategies.

The policy/research and physical adaptation strategies
developed as part of this pilot all include information on the
process and partners needed for implementation,
preliminary scopes/conceptual designs (including cost
estimates), potential barriers, and a summary of impacts of
implementation. This information is helping to inform
regional and state policy and investment decisions, and the
overall process is serving as a framework for similar projects
in the region.

The vulnerability assessment found that 636 miles of roads
in the region have the potential to be inundated by a 100year flood. The pilot project also found that the increase in

The TDOT team conducted an extreme weather
vulnerability assessment of transportation
infrastructure across the state. The project team
compiled a statewide inventory of the most critical
transportation infrastructure and used historical and
projected climate and weather data as well as
stakeholder feedback to develop rankings of the
vulnerability of critical transportation assets to
projected temperature and precipitation changes and
other extreme weather events.
The WSDOT team examined adaptation options in the
Skagit River Basin, an area of the state identified in an
earlier assessment as highly vulnerable to flooding.
Adaptation options centered on 11 vulnerable road
segments in the study area. Options included active
traffic management, detour routes, basin-wide flood
easements, and culvert improvements.
The WFLHD/ADOT&PF team assessed three unique
climate change issues in the state of Alaska. In
Kivalina, the pilot considered the impact of the loss of
sea ice, sea level rise, and wind on shoreline erosion of
the coastal runway. In Igloo Creek and along the

The team found that climate impacts vary greatly across the
state, with different events creating high levels of
vulnerability in west, middle, and east Tennessee. TDOT
intends to select 15-20 of the most vulnerable assets
identified by the study for a more detailed analysis and
initiate a dialogue on how to incorporate results from the
study into TDOT and MPO policies and procedures across
Tennessee. TDOT also plans to use the vulnerability
assessment in developing a risk-based transportation asset
management plan.
The WSDOT team explored using a then-in-process U.S.
Army Corps of Engineers flood study of the Skagit River
Basin to understand vulnerabilities, identify adaptation
strategies, and foster interagency collaboration. The team
found that this model-based analysis validated and
complemented their earlier workshop and interview-based
analysis and that it is critical to communicate proposed
actions between agencies.
In addition to looking at primary variables such as
temperature and precipitation, the WFLHD/ADOT&PF team
considered it important to also consider secondary and
tertiary variables, such as permafrost thaw and landslides,
respectively.

3 Lessons Learned from 2013-2015 Pilot Efforts
3.1 Successful Approaches
The 2013-2015 pilot teams drew from the successful approaches from the 2010-2011 projects
that helped inform the Climate Change and Extreme Weather Vulnerability Assessment
Framework (illustrated in Figure 2).1 Illustrative examples of lessons learned from the 20132015 pilot projects are presented below in alignment with the key elements of the framework.
The section outlining successful approaches within Step 3 includes two main components: (1)
identify, analyze, and prioritize adaptation options and (2) incorporate results into
transportation
programs
and processes.

3.1.1 Defining Scope
Framing the scope of a study is an important first component in order to determine the level of
detail required in the analysis and form bounds to the study, minimizing data collection and
analysis activities that would ultimately be extraneous to study objectives. Elements to consider
when defining the scope of a study include geography, decision timeframe, and coverage of
assets and climate stressors.
Pilots considered project budget and timeline, data availability, and near-term priorities when
determining the project scale. A few pilots limited their study areas to a few locations to pilot
an approach that they intend to replicate.






MnDOT piloted their vulnerability assessment approach in two districts that have
experienced particularly severe flooding in recent years. Piloting their approach helped
ground-truth the vulnerabilities and develop and refine a replicable approach. The pilot
team also framed the project to identify cost-effective resilient planning and design
solutions for specific facilities where replacement is already planned, which will help
integrate the results into decision-making for near-term priorities.
ADOT sought to maximize analysis within the project budget and timeline by focusing
on a highway corridor that includes a variety of urban areas, landscapes, biotic
communities and climate zones, which represent a range of weather conditions
applicable to much of Arizona.
WFLHD/ADOT&PF used a representative case study approach to assess climate
vulnerabilities and identify adaptation options; the size and range of climate impacts in
the State of Alaska precluded undertaking a statewide assessment within the available
time and budget.

Several pilot teams leveraged existing studies to stretch available project funds to encompass a
more expansive scope. The teams coordinated with other agencies at the project outset to
identify the relevant existing studies and continued to engage the project team from those
studies throughout the project.




WSDOT built off of the statewide climate change vulnerability assessment conducted in
the 2010-2011 pilot study and focused on examining adaptation options in a highly
vulnerable area of the state, the Skagit River Basin. The pilot framed the scope of the
study to take advantage of data from a major flood risk reduction study by the U.S.
Army Corps of Engineers in the basin.
Maine DOT’s pilot project dovetailed with a National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration (NOAA)-funded Project of Special Merit (POSM) that studied the effect
of sea level rise on marsh migration in six coastal towns. The pilot team defined the
scope of the vulnerability assessment to transportation assets in the same study area in
14



order to leverage the findings and products from the previous study, including marsh
and sea migration maps.
NYSDOT and its partner, The Nature Conservancy (TNC), had previously carried out
several projects that were useful for this pilot effort, including: a climate assessment for
the Lake Champlain Basin, the development of a culvert prioritization model, and culvert
inventory in the Ausable River watershed. The past projects helped define the scope of
analysis to inform prioritization of stream crossings for upgrades that would improve
both climate resilience and fish passage.

Pilot teams also leveraged the expertise of stakeholders, partner agencies, academic
institutions, and other local partners. These project stakeholders and partners helped identify
relevant existing data and resources, which helped pilot teams frame the study scope. Some
partners also provided analytical assistance throughout the project.







MnDOT and Iowa DOT hydraulic engineers were central to their vulnerability
assessment and adaptation planning processes.
Iowa DOT partnered with Iowa State University for projected continuous daily rainfall,
and with the University of Iowa Flood Center for hydrologic modeling that supported
the vulnerability assessment.
NYSDOT partnered with the United States Geological Survey (USGS) to develop an
enhanced StreamStats tool that incorporates future climate projections into streamflow
statistics.
Most pilots set up advisory groups to engage stakeholders and vet data and
approaches. For example, the role of the Caltrans technical advisory group was to
review project progress, contribute to vulnerability and adaptation rankings, and
contribute ideas and knowledge to the overall process.

Finally, pilots considered a broad range of stressors in their analyses, including non-climate
stressors, within available resources. Vulnerabilities are often interrelated and non-climate
stressors (e.g., economic development) can also have larger repercussions on the
transportation system than climate change.


NCTCOG evaluated extreme events such as snow, ice storms, and thunderstorms that
have disrupted transportation in the past in addition to climate stressors that North
Central Texas more typically experiences such as extreme heat, heavy rainfall and
flooding, and drought. The pilot team also analyzed the urban heat island effect as
another heat stressor.

3.1.2 Assessing Vulnerability
The Climate Resilience Pilot projects demonstrated multiple ways to assess climate-related
transportation system vulnerabilities. Possible approaches range from qualitative to
quantitative, from data-driven to stakeholder-driven, and from regional to asset-specific. The
“right” approach is the one that fits within available resources (e.g., time, data, engagement)
and, more importantly, provides the necessary information to help the agency make more
climate-informed decisions in the future.
Despite the variety of approaches, several common themes emerged from the 19 pilot projects.
Chief among them was how pilots collected and utilized institutional knowledge, working
closely with maintenance and other staff as part of the vulnerability assessment process. For
example:


Caltrans District 1 worked with
maintenance staff to create maps of
historical events, including miles per
event, cost per mile, and total cost. The
exercise drew from a maintenance
information database as well as
interviews with maintenance staff.
MnDOT consulted maintenance staff
and engineers in developing and
evaluating indicators. For example, for
the “previous flood issues” indicator,
MnDOT held a working session with

flooded in the past 20 years.
Additionally, the project team worked with MnDOT structural and water resources
engineers to weight each indicator so that indicators perceived as more important to
characterizing vulnerability could be factored more heavily into the final scores.
CAMPO worked with state and local maintenance and engineering staff to establish at
which thresholds specific extreme weather stressors are most likely to disrupt,
deteriorate, or damage the transportation system. Thresholds included those based on
design specifications as well as empirical, or observed, thresholds at which damage had
occurred in the past.
TDOT developed and administered an online survey of more than 400 transportation
experts and stakeholders across the state to assess the potential impacts to different
types of assets when exposed to a variety of extreme weather hazards. The 220
respondents evaluated the impacts according to a four-point qualitative scale (nominal,
16





moderate, significant, and catastrophic). The results of the survey were used to create
impact scores for each asset type and weather category combination in the assessment.
MassDOT held several “Institutional Knowledge” meetings with a variety of staff
members (e.g., electrical engineers, maintenance, asset management) with detailed
knowledge about the Central Artery/Tunnel System. The meetings were used to
prioritize assets for inclusion in the vulnerability assessment, to identify existing
datasets, and to understand the interdependencies in the system.
NYSDOT compiled information about vulnerable road-stream crossings and road
segment data through development of statewide GIS layers and by local outreach. The
Nature Conservancy met with staff from Essex and Clinton County Departments of
Public Works and Town highway supervisors from Essex and Clinton County and mapped
their local vulnerable assets.

Pilots effectively engaged stakeholders using maps and other visualization tools, finding them
to be a straightforward way to convey data-heavy analyses and findings. In addition, historical
extreme weather events can serve as useful
proxies to facilitate discussions of future
vulnerabilities from climate change.

ODOT presented district maintenance
crew and technical staff with a web-based
GIS map with layers on existing conditions
with locations of known hazards and
weather-related incident response (Figure
4) and future sea levels. ODOT also
mapped maintenance records related to
flooding, high water, landslides, and
rockfalls. Using the historical and future
climate data provided and their local
knowledge, the workshop participants
identified “climate hazard sites” on the
map.

mean and extreme conditions with asset
data in GIS. The maps and information from historical maintenance events helped the
team evaluate the potential for impact, defined as the level of interruption of service of
the asset.
17

Several pilots took advantage of existing datasets and vulnerability assessment tools to
complete their assessments. When necessary, the pilots modified the existing tools to meet
their specific needs and circumstances.

MDSHA used the U.S. DOT CMIP Data Processing to collect precipitation projections for
the study area. The pilot team also used the U.S. DOT Vulnerability Assessment Scoring
Tool (VAST) to arrive at a preliminary composite vulnerability score for bridges and
adjusted the scores through a workshop with MDSHA’s engineers.
CAMPO used VAST to collect and organize data on each of the nine critical assets
analyzed and to develop risk ratings for each asset. CAMPO built on the default
information in VAST by adding a few additional indicators, reviewing and refining the
default scoring mechanisms, and generating customized risk outputs.
TDOT used the U.S. DOT CMIP Climate Data Processing Tool to obtain downscaled
projected data for extreme
temperatures and precipitation in four
major Tennessee cities (Nashville,
Knoxville, Chattanooga, and Memphis).
In using the tool, TDOT selected data from
all 21 available CMIP5 climate models
for each of the tool runs in order to
obtain the most robust current
projections using the best available
science.
ADOT developed a batch processing
script to make the U.S. DOT CMIP
Climate Data Processing Tool evaluate
the entire 300-mile study corridor with
greater ease than conducting individual
runs for each segment of the corridor
(Figure 5).
ODOT used R programming language
for statistical computing of climate
data, which they found to be easier and Figure 5. ADOT-modified CMIP Climate Data

quicker than ArcGIS. The pilot team
over large geographic areas (figure shown is

MDOT used its scour critical bridge inventory and analysis framework for determining
criticality. This approach was consistent with existing practices, allowing MDOT to more
readily integrate findings into other planning and investment analysis efforts.

Data collection and analysis can be one of the most challenging elements of a climate change
vulnerability assessment. Pilots learned to consider a variety of approaches to data processing
in order to find the approach best suited to their context. In addition, pilots learned that other
agencies may have the data they need, particularly hydraulic/hydrologic data, so partnerships
are important to make sure DOTs have access to the data they need and in a format that will be
compatible with other parts of the analysis. The pilots took a wide variety of approaches to
collecting and analyzing climate and asset data.
Hydrological analyses
Determining how hydrology and floodplains may change as a result of changing
precipitation patterns is one of the most challenging tasks facing transportation
agencies. Seven of the pilots focused on overcoming this challenge. Example approaches
from these pilots are provided below.


Iowa DOT incorporated rainfall simulations into a highly detailed CUENCAS
hydrologic model to determine future peak discharge flows. The model
independently calculated the percentage of daily rainfall that is absorbed into
the soil and the percentage that is runoff for each unit of landscape. Because it is
a continuous model, precipitation in the days or hours before a rainfall event is
stored in the model. This allowed the project team to see that big storms have a
larger impact when preceded by small events that increase the antecedent
moisture content. Iowa DOT found that, under the climate model projections, all
six critical interstate and highway locations would be exposed to streamflow that
exceeds current design standards. Bridge and highway resilience would need to
be improved in four of the six pilot bridge locations to withstand the projected
increases in extreme streamflow.

 WSDOT leveraged a federal flood study for their target river basin—the U.S.
Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Skagit River Flood Risk Management General
Investigation Study (GI study). The GI study provided hydraulic data on major
flood scenarios under existing conditions, including a digital elevation model
(DEM) of the floodplain and water surface elevation and depth for several return
interval floods (influenced by climate change). WSDOT used the information to
determine maximum flood depths and extents for their highway segments under
the different scenarios.
 CAMPO acquired projections of the future magnitude of various 24-hour
precipitation events (e.g., 25-year, 100-year) and used them as input to a
physics-based flood model for the study area that is currently used as part of the
City of Austin’s Flood Early Warning System. The model outputs flood extent, top
width, flow rate, depth, average velocity, and cross-sectional area each of these
future events.
 MnDOT performed a system-level vulnerability screen, and then detailed
analyses on two culverts. For the system-level screen, MnDOT calculated several
hydrological metrics of vulnerability, including the percent change in peak design
flow required for overtopping for each asset. This provided a sense of the
relative sensitivity of each asset to precipitation changes, and required less
precise information about exactly how precipitation or flows may change in that
location. MnDOT also calculated projected stream velocity, belt width to span
length ratio, percent forest land cover in the drainage area, and other exposure
20



metrics. For the site-specific analyses, MnDOT modeled peak flows through the
culverts for various storm event return intervals and climate scenarios using the
USDA-Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) WinTR-20 program. The
program calculates runoff based on drainage area, land cover, soils, time of
concentration, and 24-hour precipitation.
CTDOT evaluated the long-term
adequacy of their bridge and
culvert structures design
standards using the Rational
Method, SCS Unit Hydrograph,
or USGS Regression Equations
(StreamStats), depending on
watershed size. For each
structure, CTDOT prepared a
graph showing how the design
discharge would increase based
on incremental increases in the

discharge (Source: CTDOT)
also developed performance
(Rating) curves for the structures showing Headwater Depth versus Peak
Discharge and Outlet Velocity versus Peak Discharge over a range of flow
conditions. These rating curves along with the precipitation graph were used to
evaluate the hydraulic adequacy and assess the adaptive capacity of the
structures.

Storm surge modeling
Sophisticated storm surge modeling may be appropriate for areas with very critical,
expensive infrastructure. For example, in heavily populated areas with critical
transportation infrastructure such as the Central Artery/Tunnel in Boston, highresolution hydrodynamic modeling is warranted due to the importance of
transportation and human impacts, as well as the spatial complexity of terrain and
bathymetry.

21



MassDOT used the ADvanced CIRCulation (ADCIRC) model because of its ability
to accommodate complex geometries and bathymetries and heterogeneous
parameter values. The team coupled ADCRIC with the Simulating WAves
Nearshore (SWAN) Model to simulate storm-induced waves in concert with the
hydrodynamics (the
coupled model is
called the Boston
Harbor Flood Risk
Model (BH-FRM)).
Through model
calibration and
validation, the
project team
demonstrated that
BH-FRM is very good

impacts.

Elevation data
Detailed Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) or other Digital Elevation Model (DEM)
data can be a very valuable resource for conducting flooding vulnerability assessments
when available. Processing the data can often be very resource-intensive (see section
3.2), but the pilot projects agreed that it was worth the resources.




South Florida had the benefit of several available datasets, including LiDARderived elevation data, FEMA flood zone maps, sea level rise inundation maps,
and data on regional transportation network. These data were critical to
identifying which facilities could be inundated, especially in a flat area like South
Florida. However, compiling, reconciling, and cleaning these datasets took
considerable resources in terms of both GIS expertise and computer processing
time.
Hillsborough MPO used the Florida Digital Elevation Model (DEM) from
University of Florida’s GeoPlan to obtain topographical terrain data used to help
identify areas at risk of inundation under different sea level rise and storm surge
scenarios. The DEM was a combination of four separate DEMs covering the
Hillsborough area.
22





MnDOT has detailed LiDAR data statewide; however, it could not be used to
generate drainage areas for each asset because of the presence of “digital dams”
in the dataset (i.e. instances where water is conveyed through an embankment
by a culvert that is not recognized in the LiDAR data). Instead, the pilot found
that StreamStats is an acceptable replacement when LiDAR is inaccurate.
MDSHA worked with the Salisbury University Eastern Shore Regional GIS
Cooperative to develop countywide Digital Elevation Models of water surfaces
using recent LiDAR surveys.

To ward off data collection and management challenges, several pilots found success with
“low-tech” qualitative screening approaches that helped provide a more targeted set of data
requirements.




Maine DOT, for example, manually selected the highest priority asset in each town
without using a Decision Support Tool to rank criticality since local knowledge about
which assets were most vulnerable was easily obtainable; in most towns, there was only
one frequently flooded asset to rank; and the quality and availability of data to input
into the tool was quite variable.
CAMPO conducted a half-day workshop with local stakeholders to determine which
critical assets to focus on for the study.’

Finally, several pilots used a combination of climate projections, asset data, institutional
knowledge, and other indicators to develop vulnerability scores. CAMPO, Maine DOT, MDOT,
MDSHA, MnDOT, and South Florida all used indicators broken into the vulnerability
components of Exposure, Sensitivity, and Adaptive Capacity. NYSDOT developed a Risk Score
based on a Vulnerability Score and a Criticality Score (derived from critical facility data and
functional road class scores). Caltrans and ODOT also calculated vulnerability scores, but
categorized their indicators differently: Caltrans into Impact Potential indicators and Criticality
Indicators, and ODOT into simply Vulnerability indicators. Regardless of the terminology used,
all pilots applied the same general principle that vulnerability is a function of the likelihood of
experiencing an impact (via experiencing a stressor and then experiencing damage or disruption
from that stressor), and the consequences of the impact.
These pilots built on the “indicator libraries” developed in DOT’s Gulf Coast Study Phase 2 and
published in U.S. DOT’s VAST. Most of these pilots used some established indicators from U.S.
DOT and also developed their own based on data available and unique circumstances to the
pilots. The pilots applied these indicators using either VAST, their own spreadsheets, or GIS
analyses.

23

Table 2 provides a consolidated list of vulnerability indicators used across the pilot projects. The
Caltrans and ODOT indicators are labeled with the effective vulnerability component of each
indicator rather than their own terminology to facilitate comparison with the other pilots. Table
2 shows the following:








Certain indicators were popular across many pilots. For example:
o Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT), detour length, FHWA roadway Functional
Classification, truck traffic volume, and evacuation route status were common as
adaptive capacity indicators.
o Scour criticality and various condition ratings (e.g., bridge substructure, bridge
deck, bridge superstructure, culvert, channel, pipe, and pavement condition)
were common as indicators of sensitivity to flooding.
The pilots used a wide variety of flooding exposure indicators. All are similar – related to
the extent and depth of inundation—but arrived at in different ways depending on data
availability. Some used inundation models and others used estimates of stream flow or
other factors to approximate exposure.
Pilots used some of the same indicators in different ways, which illustrates the potential
overlap between vulnerability components. For example:
o MnDOT used stream velocity as an exposure indicator, while CAMPO used it to
indicate sensitivity.
o Maine DOT used elevation above the 100-year base flood elevation as a
sensitivity indicator, while South Florida and CAMPO used it as an exposure
indicator.
All pilots involved stakeholders to select their indicators. For example, MDSHA used a
stakeholder-driven process to select indicators – at a workshop, participants ranked a
list of indicators for their value, regardless of data availability. Then only those
indicators with data were used in the analysis, but the “high value” indicators without
data were identified as targets for future data collection efforts.

3.1.3 Integrating into Decision Making
Integrating vulnerability assessment results into decision making processes is important to
ensure that study results are efficiently used in practice. The process of identifying and
evaluating priority adaptation options ensures that adaptation measures incorporated into
decision making are the most appropriate.
3.1.3.1 Identifying, analyzing, and prioritizing adaptation options
The Climate Resilience Pilots identified and evaluated strategies to reduce vulnerability to
climate change and extreme weather events. Several key themes and successful approaches
emerged across the pilots in this process, including the need to involve stakeholders and
consider a wide range of factors in determining which adaptation options to prioritize.
The pilots also demonstrated the importance of considering a wide range of adaptation options
from the outset, including nature-based solutions in addition to infrastructure-based solutions.
For example, pilots considered managing precipitation-driven flow with natural storage
solutions such as wetlands alongside design changes in drainage structures.






NYSDOT developed a culvert prioritization methodology to identify culverts that have
high ecological value. The team evaluated culvert sizing changes to both reduce
potential flooding and improve aquatic organism passage. The environmental analysis
considered state aquatic species of greatest conservation need and identified how much
habitat would be gained if specific culverts were made fish passable for aquatic
organisms. The flexible scoring framework creates an approach that is scalable for
application in both towns and across New York State.
Caltrans’ adaptation assessment focused on engineering-based options but also
explored opportunities to incorporate ecosystem-based adaptation, such as wetlands,
and non-structural solutions, such as traffic routing and policy changes.
WFLHD/ADOT&PF considered a range of adaptation options for their Igloo Creek
landslide study location, from revegetating the hillside with native plants to constructing
a hardened landslide protective shed over the roadway.

Once they brainstormed strategies, pilots also had to evaluate those strategies to decide which
were most appropriate to pursue. Pilots used a variety of approaches to evaluate strategies,
outlined below, ranging from using existing tools to developing and scoring their own criteria,
to using stakeholder input. The types of factors the pilots considered in evaluating adaptation
strategies included: effectiveness, costs, benefits (in terms of avoided damages, avoided delays,
etc.), co-benefits, flexibility of design, and implementation barriers, among others.
Pilot teams’ approaches to evaluating adaptation strategies included:

31

Leverage existing adaptation tools, processes, and datasets to assist in evaluating adaptation
alternatives








MnDOT and ADOT&PF used the General Process for Transportation Facility Adaptation
Assessments (the 11-Step Process) developed under the U.S. DOT Gulf Coast Study
Phase 2 for their asset-specific analysis. The Process provides an 11-step framework to
consider climate change and identify the best methods for decision-making at the
project level. The steps are generally as follows:
o Describe the site context
o Describe the existing/proposed facility
o Identify climate stressors that may impact infrastructure components
o Decide on climate scenarios and determine the magnitude of changes
o Assess performance of the existing/proposed facility
o Identify adaptation option(s)
o Assess performance of the adaptation option(s)
o Conduct an economic analysis
o Evaluate additional decision-making considerations
o Select a course of action
o Plan and conduct ongoing activities
Maine DOT applied a previously-developed infrastructure evaluation tool and modified
it to be specific to transportation assets. The team used the Transportation-version of
the Coastal Adaptation to Sea level rise Tool (T-COAST) to evaluate the costs and
benefits of alternative design structures.
ODOT used ground-based LiDAR datasets to evaluate erosion rates and develop a
graphical representation cross-section of existing terrain and roadway geometry at a
coastal bluff site to assess adaptation options to landslide impacts.
Hillsborough MPO relied on series of models (e.g., sea level rise, storm surge, travel
demand, and REMI (economic). The pilot team reported that, “Although all of these
models have the potential to provide valuable insights, they also require an involved set
of assumptions and calibrations—and results require quality control and interpretation
prior to serving as inputs for subsequent modeling. Agencies conducting first phase
assessments are counseled to focus on mastering one or two models—ensuring that the
results are in line with expectations—and then adding complexity in subsequent
assessments.”

Develop and use criteria that systematically evaluate adaptation options in terms of what is
most important to local decision makers and stakeholders




Caltrans District 1 evaluated adaptation options using criteria such as cost, usable life,
level of performance, flexibility of design, and social and environmental considerations
and weighted these criteria based on input from stakeholders and public meetings to
reflect local priorities and values. The criteria methodology was formalized into a tool to
assist planners with the evaluation and selection of adaptation options.
MTC used a screening exercise, followed by a qualitative assessment, to select
adaptation strategies for further development. The screening exercise included
questions on the scale and replicability of the strategy, the barriers to implementation,
the urgency of action, and impacts on society/equity, environment, and economy. The
qualitative assessment used an ordinal ranking system to compare the financial, social,
environmental, and governance-related (e.g., funding, legal barriers) performance of the
strategies (see Figure 9). As a last level of review, the project team used their

33

performance of adaptation strategies.

professional experience to select a final set of balanced strategies.
Use cost benefit analysis to compare adaptation options
Pilot teams took a range of approaches to try and estimate the costs and benefits associated
with adaptation options. In some cases, pilot teams found rebuilding in kind to be most costeffective, in other cases they found building higher/stronger to be more cost effective.


MnDOT used the COAST software to calculate expected cumulative damages to
transportation facilities over time, using curves relating water depths to their
probabilities and water depths to damage costs incurred (depth-damage functions). The
model calculates damage according to asset-specific depth-damage functions each time
the facility is “flooded.” MnDOT considered two sets of costs; one that only included the
damage costs incurred by MnDOT (i.e., physical damage repair costs) and one that also
included social costs (i.e., incremental travel time costs to motorists from the detour
and the potential for injury to motorists).
NYSDOT found that many of the studies and tools reviewed were location specific, and
while they provided useful context and information, the primary tools they selected
were relevant at larger geographic scales. Ultimately, the NYSDOT project developed a
framework that enables the user to account for the triple bottom line -- ecological
impacts (e.g., fish, habitat, water quality), economic impacts (e.g., flood damage, travel
delay, tourism), and social impacts (e.g., health and safety). The approach considers
qualitative and quantitative factors and provides a menu of potential benefits that users
can tailor to different geographies and data availability. The team found that the culvert
design features that improve aquatic organism passage often improve climate change
resilience, and vice-versa.
Maine DOT analyzed the cost-effectiveness of various candidate adaptation designs by
comparing the life cycle costs of the replace-in-kind option with the adaptation options
for each asset under a range of sea level rise and storm surge scenarios. The pilot team
created depth-damage functions, which describe the estimated repair cost for an asset
at each flood elevation, and applied it to the scenarios using the T-COAST tool.
Hillsborough MPO used their regional travel demand model, the Tampa Bay Regional
Planning Model, to evaluate the impacts of road closures due to flooding, including
delays, lost trips, and operating costs. The results were then input into the regional
planning commission’s Regional Economic Models Inc. (REMI) model to assess potential
state and regional economic impacts.

Table 3 compares the cost and benefit factors, resources, key findings, and other factors of the
benefit-cost analyses used across the pilots. Most pilots took similar approaches to determine
the net cost-effectiveness of each adaptation strategy (total costs with the adaptation strategy
34

minus total costs without the adaptation strategy), including agency costs of repairs as well as
societal costs from transportation disruptions. Across the board, the pilots found the benefitcost analyses valuable but demanding, in terms of time, data, and expertise.

The pilots also engaged stakeholders to vet
adaptation options, as adaptation strategies are more
likely to be successful if developed through a
participatory process involving internal agency partners
as well as external partners.






“While a standardized qualitative
assessment can be a good way to
evaluate the performance of
strategies, it should always be
supplemented by the local
knowledge and expertise of
stakeholders and agencies”.

MTC established stakeholder groups in each of
their three geographic focus areas that
encompassed a wide range of participants
—MTC Pilot Team
including transit operators; flood control
districts; local government; utilities; parks; non-profits; community based organizations;
homeowners associations (HOAs); and federal research agencies. These stakeholders
provided critical reviews of the exposure information, and helped to review and develop
the adaptation strategies.
Caltrans District 1 held public meetings in each of the four counties in the study area
mid-way through the project to update the public on the project and seek input on
adaptation priorities and criteria. Throughout the project process, Caltrans engaged 25
members of its Technical Advisory Group, 59 regional government and regulatory
stakeholders, and 119 other members of the public.
CTDOT considered the location of assets in relation to emergency routes and emergency
services, such as fire stations; police stations and barracks; emergency medical services;
hospitals; public works departments; and emergency shelters in their criticality
assessment. The study team also conducted public outreach to the elected leaders,
emergency responders and public works department in the study region to learn about
the anecdotal or local perspective on which structures were more critical than others
that may not be evident through the roadway or hydrography datasets.

In addition, the pilots engaged low income and other disadvantaged communities, in addition
to other public and private stakeholders, where possible, in the adaptation strategy
development and evaluation processes.




WSDOT conducted interviews with two tribes resident in the basin about existing
conditions, including existing “areas of concern” regarding flood hazards and related to
critical infrastructure like firehouses and medical clinics.
Caltrans District 1 conducted outreach with key stakeholders, including local tribes in all
four of the project’s pilot locations. For example, the pilot team gave a presentation
about the project at a Tribal Climate Adaptation Forum hosted by the Robinson
Rancheria of Pomo Indians in Lake County. All four of the project’s pilot locations were

39



within ancestral tribal territories, and two (in Lake and Mendocino Counties) were
directly adjacent to tribal properties.
MTC considered the impacts (positive or negative) on disadvantaged communities when
evaluating potential adaptation options. For example, they considered the ability of the
strategy to protect transit routes in or within ½ mile of communities of concern, as well
as the ability of the strategy to minimize vehicle hours of delay for trips in the lowest
income category.

3.1.3.2 Incorporating results into transportation programs and processes
Integrating climate and vulnerability considerations into existing decision making processes
puts the findings of a vulnerability assessment and adaptation evaluation into practice.
Incorporating climate change can improve existing practices and is easier to implement this way
than treating it as a separate activity.
Several pilot teams developed resources to incorporate climate information into engineering
design.






CTDOT is preparing a technical memorandum providing recommendations to Department
staff and Consulting Engineers. This memo will include guidance on using Precip.net and
NOAA Atlas 14 data. Now that NOAA has released the Atlas 14 data for the Northeastern
U.S., CTDOT plans to update the Drainage Manual to require NOAA Atlas 14 as the source
for precipitation data for the design of Department facilities.
Iowa DOT determined engineering design metrics could be developed from streamflow
simulation over a long, continuous period spanning historical and future climate conditions
(e.g., continuous streamflow for 1960 – 2059). To facilitate the use of this information, Iowa
DOT developed an innovative flood design graph for bridge vulnerability analysis that
conveys succinctly to bridge engineers the historical annual peak streamflow as well as
design metrics based on historical data and climate projection data. However, Iowa DOT
cautions that the graphs should only be used with careful interpretation since it contains
both historical and projected data that is not strictly fair to compare.
MassDOT developed high-resolution flooding projections for use in future project design
that are being used not only by MassDOT, but by other organizations in the Boston area.

Several pilot teams aligned their assessments with long range planning and other existing
practices, which facilitated the integration of the results into decision making.


TDOT evaluated vulnerabilities to current infrastructure and projected use of assets based
on their current Long Range Transportation Plan (LRTP). The temporal scope of the study
extended through the year 2040, which aligned with the horizon year of the plan as well as
capital and rehabilitation cycles.
40








ODOT reviewed federal, state, and local land use regulations in order to understand the
restrictions that may limit the feasibility of large coastal adaptation projects.
Hillsborough MPO conducted its assessment in support of its 2040 LRTP. Project findings,
such as inundation scenarios and viable adaptation measures, have been cost-effectively
incorporated into the LRTP.
Caltrans District 1 is considering updates to Caltrans planning and design policies to
integrate climate, such as updating the maintenance and repair data collection and tracking
systems to collect data related to extreme weather events. Caltrans recognizes the need for
greater collaboration between permitting authorities and project stakeholders to conduct
advanced planning and permitting for adaptation options that can be implemented after
emergency events.
MDSHA is using the results of this study to delineate a “Climate Change Impact Zone.” This
zone is intended to help SHA screen new project plans and designs for future climate
impacts.

A number of pilot teams streamlined climate change adaptation planning with asset
management.






MnDOT used information from their asset management system as indicators of
vulnerability; however, they recognize that this system could be improved. For future
efforts, they are considering gathering data on waterway opening dimensions and other
relevant variables that would be useful to future flood vulnerability assessments, and
incorporating vulnerability assessment scores into asset management databases and the
asset management plan. Moving forward, they recommend including monitoring and
recording asset performance during weather events. Specific items that could be recorded
include frequency of overtopping, duration of closures, whether injuries resulted from the
overtopping, and any damage costs. Instances where an adaptive design prevented the
incurrence of costs relative to a traditional design should also be noted and a tally
maintained of costs avoided; eventually this could be used to determine whether the
additional costs incurred for the adaptation were justified.
CTDOT is coordinating with the Bridge Management group to determine how to integrate
the results of the hydraulic evaluations and criticality assessments into the bridge inventory
for future reference by the Department. One means would be to upload the structure
summary reports and criticality sheets (produced during the pilot) into the bridge asset files
located in their project management file system, “ProjectWise”.
Iowa DOT is adding data generated during the pilot project into their BridgeWatch program,
a real-time bridge monitoring and alert system. BridgeWatch provides real-time information
about bridge and stream conditions to help Iowa DOT decision-makers take a proactive
approach to public safety during potential overtopping events.
41



NCTCOG considered doing an analysis of how extreme weather events affected pavement
deterioration since the City of Dallas has a robust dataset of historical street conditions,
including the extent and severity of pavement distress. However, the database system is
currently not configured in such a way to indicate that extreme weather effects are a direct
cause to specific street section degradation or failures. As an outcome of the pilot project,
NCTCOG is recommending that the City improve its monitoring of weather-related stresses
as part of its pavement management system.

These types of projects can create an opportunity to get agencies to communicate and
coordinate efforts to address climate change. The pilot teams engaged and coordinated with
various partners and stakeholders on the vulnerability assessments and adaptation analyses,
which were important outcomes of the projects. A number of the pilots will continue to work
with partners to plan for climate.


WSDOT’s pilot project demonstrated the value of working with federal and local
partners such as the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, flood managers, and county public
works departments. Such partnerships allow the organizations to inform each other’s
work and reduce potential future conflicts. For example, the project identified locations
where WSDOT, if unaware of the Corps’ tentatively selected plans or local flood
improvements, could inadvertently make investments that would block the flow of
water that the Corps assumed would occur. Following on the pilot project, WSDOT is
working with the state departments of Commerce and Ecology to develop guidance for
local vulnerability assessments. WSDOT intends to coordinate with local governments
on integrating climate resilience considerations into their long-range planning efforts.

3.2 Challenges Encountered
The pilot teams also encountered challenges to the assessment process and identified lessons
learned that can be applied to future projects. This section includes a few common challenges
and illustrative examples of ways the pilot teams reconciled them.
When defining the scope of their analyses, several pilots had difficulty deciding on the
appropriate scale for assessment. The project scoping phase should include consideration of
what data are available, since the scope of the assessment may need to consider the quality
and availability of the data.


NCTCOG found it challenging to collect comprehensive and consistent data from across a
twelve-county metropolitan planning area, more than 230 local government units, and
multiple transportation providers. As a result, the study assumed adaptive capacity was
constant throughout the study region since data was not available to support the analysis.

42

The pilot teams encountered challenges with data collection and processing. For some pilot
teams, there were several available sources of data available and the pilots were overwhelmed
with data processing. Pilots also encountered a number of challenges in identifying the best
data to work with and applying it, especially when there was imperfect or missing data and
uncertainty in the climate models. Several pilots were able to use qualitative screening
techniques to minimize their data collection needs.








MDOT did not have digitized FEMA floodplain data for approximately 60 percent of the
state. Therefore, the study team chose not to incorporate 100-year floodplain data into its
analysis, but did flag assets within the National Flood Hazard Layer coverage area and the
100-year floodplain in the final vulnerability assessment.
MDOT found that, for some climate scenarios, changes in precipitation ranged between
models from very little to a greater than 60 percent increase. To deal with uncertainty, the
study used five climate models to capture the range of potential future climate impacts.
MnDOT found that uncertainty in the downscaled precipitation data is uncomfortable for
engineers who have worked primarily with statistically derived data from the past to
identify asset risk. An indicator for capturing differences in projected future 24-hour
precipitation depths within each asset’s drainage area was considered. The Climate
Advisory Committee believed, however, that any variations in climate model projections
across an area as small as a district would not be reliable. Thus, the assessment took a
sensitivity-based approach to capturing vulnerability, asking, “Given what we know about
each asset and its environmental setting, what percentage change in the design storm
would be required to overtop the roadway?” All other metrics being equal, assets that
required less of a change in design flow to overtop were considered more vulnerable to
potential increases in precipitation.
Iowa DOT used complex modeling to translate climate model information into future
streamflow which required significant computing infrastructure that is common with
academic research institutions but may not be available to most public agencies and
consulting firms. The use of cloud computing could make access to this computing power
much more cost effective.

While coordination with partners and stakeholders is a valuable part of the assessment and
integration process, there were a few challenges that pilot teams had to overcome, including
logistics and communication.


Hillsborough MPO engaged with a pre-existing hazard mitigation strategy working group
composed of government officials, representatives from local businesses, and private
citizens. The pilot team found that while this technical advisory group was a valuable
resource for the project, the composition of attendees varied significantly across project
43



meetings, making continuity a challenge. If needed again in the future, Hillsborough MPO
would consider assembling a smaller, dedicated technical advisory group that could meet
more frequently and provide consistent feedback.
CTDOT found that there needs to be a common understanding of the purpose of adaptation
strategies among all stakeholders (e.g., local towns, private land owners) due to the
potential for increased downstream flooding when structures are upsized.

A few pilots encountered difficulty in the review and verification of assessment results. They
needed to determine what type of review and verification of results is needed and by whom.
Additionally, several pilots noted that the data obtained from other entities should be vetted to
ensure that it can be appropriately applied to the project.


As Iowa DOT and MassDOT found, it can be challenging to obtain critical peer review of the
pilot projects’ new methods and the findings that result. Exactly how climate change will
affect infrastructure systems is an emerging area of research in which there are few
established best practices. The pilots, as a community of practice, embraced this challenge
and worked together to provide feedback to each other and develop best practices. In
addition, they’ve given several presentations to share their research and gather feedback
on the approaches used.

The community of practice created through the pilot program provided an opportunity for
pilots to share these challenges and how they learned to overcome them. The pilots also
conferred regarding outstanding needs and recommendations for FHWA to continue to support
state and local transportation agencies in addressing some of these challenges (see sections 4
and 5 below).

4 Needs
The Climate Resilience Pilots have made significant advances in the “state of the practice” in
adapting transportation systems to climate change. In the process, they identified several
needs for additional information and resources to continue the work of making our
transportation systems more resilient. Simultaneously, the pilot projects have made advances
against those needs and developed resources to help other agencies.

4.1 Information Needs
Data. In order to fully understand vulnerabilities and take action to address them,
transportation agencies need access to comprehensive datasets that can support their
analyses. These include data on transportation assets (e.g., from asset management systems),
LiDAR or other elevation data, and relevant data on climate projections. Data will never be

44

perfect, but continuous improvement is needed to better understand vulnerabilities and
adaptation tradeoffs.
Information on historical impacts and associated costs. Such information—such as the
duration and extent of road closures, labor and maintenance costs associated with weatherrelated repairs, and economic implications of road closures—can help decision makers
understand the potential impacts, in dollar terms, of extreme weather impacts. Information
about the broader economic implications of transportation disruptions (e.g., if an interstate is
closed, if industrial routes are closed, if local business and industry are affected by road
closures) is also critical to informed decisions, but typically difficult to obtain. Some pilots were
able to calculate historical costs from weather events (see Caltrans, Maine DOT, MTC, NCTCOG,
and ODOT pilot reports).
Information on “default” values for costs and benefits

particular, developed a framework designed for other
transportation agencies to use to assign economic
values to social, economic, and environmental benefits of adaptation. Their report includes
several default values, and noted that the lack of developing locally-specific data was a limiting
factor.

4.2 Other Resource Needs
Additional guidance on using climate information. Climate change projections are readily
available, but there are so many data sources and options that it is often well outside the
expertise of DOT staff to sort through it. Although several resources exist for how to use climate
45

information from organizations like FHWA, the Infrastructure Climate Network (ICNet), and
National Cooperative Highway Research Program (NCHRP) (see Appendix A), the pilots
suggested additional guidance is necessary specifically for transportation agencies on what
climate information to use, where to find it, how to use it (e.g., what types of climate data are
needed for different types of analyses).
Additional guidance on conducting benefit cost assessments for climate adaptation.
Transportation agencies need more examples and information on how to incorporate climate
change into benefit-cost assessments and other economic assessments of project viability. For
example, such guidance would include information on how to find and apply existing data on
costs and benefits (including putting values on benefits), assign probabilities to climate change
scenarios, scale inputs, forecast socioeconomic variables, do Monte Carlo analyses, and use
other economic analysis techniques. Transportation agency staff may have limited expertise in
economic analysis, so guidance should be tailored to that audience and, for example, include
default values, be realistic about what data can and should be used, and provide examples of
how others have incorporated benefit-cost analyses into decision making. Any processes in
future guidance or tools also needs to be transparent to enhance acceptance and
understanding of results by engineers and others involved in the decision making process.
Several resources, listed in Appendix A, already exist to help organizations perform economic
analyses, and the pilot projects provide several examples of how to perform transportation
climate change-specific analyses (see Table 3). In addition, the NYSDOT pilot developed
guidance specifically for this purpose.
Guidance on integration of vulnerability assessment results and adaptation into
transportation planning. Though the Climate Resilience Pilots are a good start, the
transportation community needs more guidance and examples of how to actually integrate
understanding of climate risk into transportation decision-making. For example, transportation
agencies could use a data collection checklist of additional climate and asset information that
would be helpful when developing or updating asset management systems. This would have
helped the South Florida pilot project, for instance, which could not easily find data at the asset
level that would have been helpful for their hydrology and vulnerability analysis (e.g., bridge
deck elevations, size of openings).

5 Pilot Recommendations for FHWA
Throughout the pilot process and in their final reports, the 19 pilot teams identified specific
recommendations for ways FHWA can continue to support state and local transportation
agencies as they attempt to increase their resilience to extreme weather events and climate
change. These recommendations fall into five overall categories.
46

Further refine the Climate Change and Extreme Weather Vulnerability Assessment
Framework to reflect lessons learned from pilot projects. The vast majority of
recommendations from the pilots were specific suggestions to improve the content and scope
of the FHWA Climate Change and Extreme Weather Vulnerability Assessment Framework. For
example, recommendations include:











Expand the “Integrate into Decision-Making” component of the framework to help agencies
move beyond vulnerability assessments. For example, this may include guidance on using
risk-based decision-making in engineering, information on how to incorporate climate
change projections into design, and guidance on how to go about making the difficult
decisions associated with climate change adaptation (e.g., when do I abandon this road?).
Move toward an FHWA Adaptation Framework.
Expand the discussion on the appropriate use of climate data in vulnerability assessments
and engineering decisions. For example, elaborate on the uncertainty associated with
climate projections, what climate data can and cannot be used for, a recommended process
for selecting climate models, and how to interpret projections when the directionality does
not agree.
Add guidance on identifying and evaluating adaptation measures.
Expand the framework to more explicitly address issues related to operations and
maintenance, as opposed to infrastructure only.
Include more detail and examples about how to implement vulnerability assessments.
Incorporate specific lessons learned by pilots into relevant sections of the framework. For
example, emphasize the importance of stakeholder engagement and note challenges and
best practices associated with data collection.
Incorporate examples from this round of pilot projects into the “Examples from Practice”
call-outs.

Additional details on specific recommendations are provided in the pilot final reports.
Provide resources to help agencies evaluate the costs and benefits of adaptation strategies.
These resources could fall within an updated FHWA Framework, but would require sufficient
new content and research that it merits a separate category. The FHWA pilots program has
helped agencies assess their vulnerabilities and some have begun to evaluate and implement
strategies to adapt to those vulnerabilities. However, guidance on the appropriate ways to

47

evaluate the costs and benefits of adaptation strategies is still limited.6 FHWA could help
advance the state of the practice through the following activities, for example:







Develop an adaptation economic analysis resource guide documenting existing
resources (e.g., guidance, tools, and data).
Compile the most useful data related to valuing benefits of adaptation, such as
databases with monetized values for lost travel time, ecosystem damages, and other
key data. Pair this with case studies of assessments and results that could be applied to
other localities or areas and a table of default values.
Develop a data collection guide with steps that agencies can take in the near-term to
improve their ability to conduct adaptation benefit/cost analyses in the future. For
example, this guide would provide data points to collect and explain why they are useful
in understanding costs, benefits, and effectiveness. For example, frequency and
duration of weather-related road closures is a helpful data point to understand how
weather events disrupt the system and what the benefits of avoided disruptions might
be.
Develop a framework for economic analysis of adaptation strategies, covering options
for economic analyses (e.g., benefit/cost ratios, return-on-investment analyses, multicriteria analysis), the pros and cons of different analysis options, and ways to
incorporate non-quantitative factors in decision-making.

Provide additional tools and resources developed during the pilot projects. Several of the
pilots developed resources and processes that could serve as useful templates for other
agencies. FHWA could host these resources on the Virtual Framework for Vulnerability
Assessment website (the Virtual Framework). In addition, FHWA could help make some of the
resources more user-friendly for other users. For example, the Tennessee DOT pilot developed
a method to extract and assemble National Weather Service data to produce historic
frequencies of extreme weather events. This process could be turned into a tool to make it
easier for others to replicate.
Facilitate coordination with U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and other federal agencies. The
WSDOT pilot, in particular, focused on the opportunities for collaboration between USACE flood
management studies and DOT flood resilience efforts. In light is the overlap between USACE
and U.S. DOT work in the area of flood resilience, WSDOT recommends that DOT work with
USACE to develop a strategy for integrating their planning efforts and reduce regulatory

Extreme Weather Events,” is a starting point to address this need and expected to be complete in mid-2017.

barriers across the two agencies. Similar opportunities likely exist with other federal agencies,
so FHWA should continue to participate and engage in inter-agency coordination.
Help secure additional funding for analysis and implementation of adaptation strategies. The
nineteen pilot teams are now poised to implement strategies to adapt to projected climate
changes. However, funding is an oft-cited barrier to changing project design or embarking on
specific projects—particularly infrastructure-related projects—to address vulnerabilities. Pilot
teams requested that FHWA provide or otherwise facilitate access to funding to carry on the
work of the pilots and advance the state of the practice into implementation of adaptation
strategies.

INTRODUCTION
This report summarizes a peer exchange on climate change resilience that was held October 45, 2016 in Atlanta, Georgia and hosted by the Atlanta Regional Commission (ARC). The peer
exchange was co-organized by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) and ARC.
The transportation sector plays an important role in addressing climate change both through
reducing greenhouse gas emissions (mitigation) and addressing the impacts of climate change
(adaptation). A concept closely related to adaptation is resilience, which FHWA defines as the
ability to anticipate, prepare for, and adapt to changing conditions and withstand, respond to,
and recover rapidly from disruptions.1 Climate adaptation and resilience are gaining
momentum in the transportation sector as transportation agencies realize their infrastructure is
vulnerable to the effects of climate change. In the last several years, FHWA has been supporting
state and regional transportation agencies in climate change adaptation activities, especially in
assessing vulnerability to climate change. Building off of these vulnerability assessments,
transportation agencies are beginning to identify adaptation strategies and integrate climate
change considerations into the transportation planning and project development processes.
The Fixing America’s Surface Transportation (FAST) Act, which was signed into law on
December 4, 2015, includes new requirements for state departments of transportation (DOTs)
and metropolitan planning organizations (MPOs) to integrate resilience into the transportation
planning process. Following the authorization of the FAST Act, FHWA and the Federal Transit
Administration (FTA) updated their planning regulations2 with a requirement that the
metropolitan transportation plan assess capital investment and other strategies that reduce the
vulnerability of the existing transportation infrastructure to natural disasters (23 CFR
450.324(f)(7)). In addition, the planning rule states that MPOs should coordinate with officials
responsible for disaster risk reduction when developing a metropolitan transportation plan and
the Transportation Improvement Program (23 CFR 450.316(b)). The updated planning final rule
also added improving the resilience and reliability of the transportation system as a new
planning factor for states and MPOs to consider and implement in the transportation planning
process (23 CFR 450.206(a)(9) and 23 CFR 450.306(b)(9)).
The purpose of this peer exchange was for staff from MPOs and state DOTs to learn from peers
about best practices for integrating climate resilience into the planning process, including
assessing risks, developing adaptation options, and prioritizing projects for implementation. It
also provided an opportunity for stakeholders from the Atlanta area to connect with others in
the region working on climate resilience. Finally, FHWA will be producing resources and
information to help MPOs and state DOTs meet the FAST Act requirements related to
integrating resilience into the planning process. The peer exchange allowed FHWA to gather

OVERVIEW PRESENTATIONS
The peer exchange organizers from ARC and FHWA began the meeting by describing their past
and current work on climate resilience.
ARC’s Planning Work on Climate Change – David D’Onofrio, ARC
ARC’s climate change work to date has primarily focused on climate change mitigation,
including conducting a greenhouse gas emissions inventory, using scenario planning to evaluate
the carbon emissions impacts of various land use and transportation strategies, and
incorporating carbon pricing into all proposed projects. ARC is also pursuing projects to reduce
vehicle miles traveled and evaluating how changes in community design can reduce emissions.
ARC is beginning to work on climate change adaptation as well. The agency used FHWA’s
Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) climate data processing tool to identify ways in
which the Atlanta region’s climate will change in the future. ARC found that by 2100 Atlanta is
likely to experience more hot days, fewer days with temperatures below freezing, more
frequent heavy precipitation events, and longer periods between rain events. Moving forward,
ARC is planning to evaluate how these impacts will affect
the region’s transportation system, as well as develop

PRESENTATIONS ON CLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS
Two presentations provided participants with information on expected climate conditions and
impacts. Dr. Mike Meyer from WSP Parsons Brinkerhoff presented an overview of expected
climate changes and the effects climate change is likely to have on the transportation sector.
Paul Schramm of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) focused his presentation
on the effects that climate change will have on human health.
Climate Change Overview – Mike Meyer, WSP Parsons Brinkerhoff
Dr. Meyer described expected climate change impacts globally and in the Atlanta region.
Globally, temperatures are predicted to rise, extreme weather events are likely to become
more frequent and severe, and some regions of the world will experience more precipitation
while others will experience more drought. In Georgia, parts of the state are likely to
experience as many as 75 additional days above 95° F by 2070, and average temperatures may
increase by 5-6° F. In terms of precipitation, Georgia is likely to experience both an increase in
the number of high rainfall events and an increase in the length of time between rain events; in
other words, it is vulnerable to both flooding and drought.
For the transportation sector, these climate impacts can cause flooded roads, structural
damage to bridges and roadways, and worsened traffic conditions. In terms of flooding, much
of the work on transportation and climate change to date has focused on the impacts of sea
level rise and coastal storms. However, inland flooding can also cause major damage to
transportation systems, as evidenced by the Tennessee Superflood in 2010 and the I-680 flood
in Iowa in 2011. Heat can also negatively affect transportation infrastructure in many ways,
including:
 Instability of materials exposed to high temperatures can lead to pavement heave or
track buckling;


Exposure of encased equipment to high heat can lead to failure of equipment such as
traffic control devices and signal control systems;



Increased electricity usage and power outages during heat waves can affect the power
supply to rail operations;



Extended periods of high temperatures will affect safety conditions for employees that
work long hours outdoors, such as those working on infrastructure reconstruction and
maintenance activities;



Extreme temperatures will create dangerous conditions for many users of the
transportation system, placing greater emphasis on the use of air conditioning for
transit vehicles and stations; and



High temperatures will also negatively affect bicycle use and the desire and propensity
of individuals to walk outdoors.

Dr. Meyer concluded his presentation by discussing various ways in which climate resilience can
be considered in transportation planning, from setting goals and performance measures related
to resilience, to conducting site-specific studies, to using climate change in scenario planning or
as a criteria in project prioritization.
Climate Change and Human Health – Paul Schramm, Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention
Mr. Schramm of the CDC, which is based in Atlanta, discussed how climate change threatens
human health and wellbeing by amplifying some existing health threats as well as creating new
ones. Increased heat can lead to heat-related illnesses as well as worsening air pollution, which
itself contributes to poor health. In addition, changes in pollen production due to heat can
worsen the impacts of asthma. Fresh water supplies are affected by climate change, both
through salt water intrusion into fresh water sources in areas experiencing sea level rise and
through droughts leading to water shortages. Climate change also affects the spread of disease.
For example, heavy precipitation can increase the risks of water borne illnesses and changes in
temperatures can shift the range of mosquito-borne illnesses.
Studies have shown that reframing discussions of climate change to focus on health can be a
powerful motivator in getting people to recognize the risks and take action. The CDC’s Climate
Change and Health Program helps health departments at the state and local level prepare for
the effects of climate change by providing scientific guidance, developing decision support
tools, ensuring public concerns are considered in climate change adaptation and mitigation
strategies, and developing partnerships between public health and other sectors. This program
has provided funding to 16 states and two cities through the Climate Ready States and Cities
Initiative. Funded states and cities use the CDC’s Building Resilience Against Climate Effects
(BRACE) framework to identify likely climate impacts in their communities, potential health
effects associated with these impacts, and their most at-risk populations and locations.

PEER PRESENTATIONS
The peer exchange provided an opportunity for MPOs and state DOTs from around the country
to share their experience with climate resilience planning. The organizations that presented
varied in the actions they have taken to date, from just beginning to consider the effects of
climate change and how to plan for them, to conducting detailed vulnerability assessments, to
developing projects that address climate change impacts. All of the MPOs and state DOTs that
presented, with the exception of the Puget Sound Regional Council, received funding from
FHWA from 2013-2015 as part of the Climate Resilience Pilot Program.
Accommodating Extreme Weather Adaptation to Planning and Sustainability in North Central
Texas – Jory Dille, North Central Texas Council of Governments
North Central Texas Council of Governments (NCTCOG) covers a 12-county area with a
population of seven million in the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area. The region’s population
is expected to grow nearly 50 percent through 2040. NCTCOG is developing strategies to
address increased vehicle-miles traveled and congestion costs, plan necessary repairs on
existing infrastructure, and improve efficiency and resiliency.
NCTCOG conducted a climate change vulnerability assessment and found that climate change is
both a current and future problem. The main climate risks faced in the region are extreme heat,
heavy precipitation events and significant flooding, and lower annual rainfall and increased risk
of drought. The assessment found that roadways will be affected by both heat and flooding,
and identified significant arterial road segments that are vulnerable to these climate impacts.
To address these climate risks along with aging infrastructure and population growth, NCTCOG
has focused on transportation asset management. The agency’s long-range transportation plan,
Mobility 2040, identifies $118.9 billion for system improvements and focuses on strategies that
maximize the existing system. This represents a 27 percent increase from the last long-range
plan in funding for existing system maximization strategies. To prioritize projects, NCTCOG
scores potential projects based on performance measures, including system reliability and
environmental sustainability.
Surface Transportation Resiliency Planning in Hillsborough County, FL – Allison Yeh,
Hillsborough County Metropolitan Planning Organization
Hillsborough County, Florida has a population of 1.3 million and covers the Tampa metropolitan
area. The county is highly vulnerable to sea level rise and coastal flooding, with 158 miles of
coastline and a significant portion of the population living in areas prone to flooding. Although
the region has experienced flooding recently, it has not faced a direct hit by a hurricane in over
90 years, creating a false sense of security for residents.
Hillsborough County MPO used FHWA’s framework to conduct its vulnerability assessment.
The agency collected data on three climate variables: sea level rise, storm surge, and flooding. It
then used mapping and the regional transportation demand model to identify climate risks to
transportation assets, and sought feedback on the results from local transportation
8

stakeholders. Hillsborough County MPO also conducted an economic analysis, identifying
transportation delays and economic losses resulting from climate impacts. The MPO then
selected several assets on which to conduct a more detailed analysis to illustrate climate risks,
costs, and potential adaptation options.
Hillsborough County MPO has integrated climate considerations into its 2040 long-range
transportation plan by evaluating how investing in resilience could address the performance
measures of reduced vulnerability and crashes. The MPO found that by raising roads and
preventing shorelines from wave damage, it could reduce the time that roads would be
unusable after a Category 3 storm from eight weeks to three weeks and cut economic losses in
half over the course of the plan. Moving forward, Hillsborough County MPO will continue to
integrate climate change considerations into its next long-range transportation plan update and
coordinate with local jurisdictions on mainstreaming adaptation options for projects.
Climate Change and Extreme Weather Vulnerability Assessments and Adaptation Options of
the Central Artery – Steven Miller, Massachusetts Department of Transportation
The Massachusetts Department of Transportation (MassDOT) conducted an evaluation of
climate risks to the Central Artery/Tunnel system, a critical transportation asset in the Boston
region. The Central Artery/Tunnel is vulnerable to flooding from extreme coastal storms under
present and future conditions. MassDOT felt that the existing projections for flooding, which
were based on a bathtub model, did not give it the high quality hydrodynamic data it needed to
understand the effects of winds and waves from hurricanes and Nor’easters and the effects of
dams on the Charles and Mystic Rivers. As a result, MassDOT, along with regional partners,
conducted high resolution hydrodynamic modeling and created a new dataset showing the
effects of future sea level rise and storm surge flooding in Boston.
This data allowed MassDOT to better understand the vulnerabilities of the Central
Artery/Tunnel and develop adaptation strategies to address them. Although the modeling was
a costly project, MassDOT justified the cost because it had a low tolerance for risk to the
Central Artery/Tunnel, given that it is a new piece of infrastructure and a critical transportation
asset for the region. The new data from the Boston Harbor Flood Risk Model has been used by
local stakeholders conducting their own climate risk assessments, including the City of Boston
and surrounding municipalities, universities, and other state agencies. MassDOT is currently
expanding the model to the state’s entire coast and islands.
Maryland Adaptation and Vulnerability Assessment – Elizabeth Habic, Maryland Department
of Transportation/State Highway Administration
The State of Maryland is vulnerable to several impacts of climate change, including sea level
rise, increases in temperature, and increases in precipitation intensity and frequency. The
Maryland Department of Transportation/State Highway Administration (DOT/SHA) conducted a
FHWA climate change vulnerability assessment pilot study to assess the vulnerability of its
assets to climate change, develop methods to address current and future risk to the roadway
network, and provide process and policy recommendations. Maryland DOT/SHA chose to focus
9

its vulnerability assessment on three climate stressors related to flooding: sea level change,
storm surge, and precipitation. The vulnerability assessment focused on risks to bridges and
roadways in two coastal counties, Anne Arundel and Somerset.
To narrow down the number of assets it evaluated in detail, the Maryland DOT/SHA conducted
an initial screen to identify bridge assets located in areas vulnerable to climate change impacts.
It identified these areas based on the outer limits of the 2100 mean higher high water mark3,
the Sea, Lake, and Overland Surges from Hurricanes (SLOSH) model for a Category 3 Hurricane,
and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) 100-year floodplain boundary plus a
50 foot buffer. Maryland DOT/SHA used FHWA’s Vulnerability Assessment Scoring Tool (VAST)
to evaluate vulnerability of the assets selected in the initial screen and develop a vulnerability
score. For its evaluation of roadways, Maryland DOT/SHA developed a Hazard Vulnerability
Index (HVI) that scores risk to a roadway asset based on whether it is an evacuation route, the
flood depth under future sea level and storm events, and the functional class of the roadway.
By combining both the highway locations identified by HVI and the bridges that scored highest
in VAST, the agency was able to identify “Vulnerable Areas at Risk.” Finally, Maryland DOT/SHA
conducted an origin/destination analysis to evaluate travel times and access to random
locations both before and after a hypothetical future flood event. The analysis identified
destinations that would take longer to reach or would not be reachable in 2100 due to sea level
rise and flooding.
Maryland DOT/SHA plans to use the results of its vulnerability assessment in several ways. It
plans to flag vulnerable areas as part of its Highway Needs Inventory, a planning document that
lists major capital construction projects. It will also provide the results to the counties and
municipalities addressed in the study to help them in their planning processes. The agency is
also undergoing a reorganization, and sustainability and climate change will become the focus
of a unit within the Innovative Planning and Performance Division.
Planning for Climate Resiliency – Kelly McGourty, Puget Sound Regional Council
The Puget Sound Regional Council (PSRC) covers four counties in the Seattle metropolitan area,
with a population of approximately four million. Previous planning efforts related to climate
change largely focused on mitigation, although PSRC is now prioritizing adaptation as well. The
last long-range transportation plan, Transportation 2040, which was published in 2010 and
updated in 2014, included a white paper on adaptation to climate change for transportation
planning in the Puget Sound region. The white paper had information on identifying potential
impacts, conducting sea level rise mapping, reviewing economic impacts, and identifying
potential future adaptation strategies.
In 2015, PSRC formed a regional collaborative on climate preparedness consisting of
municipalities, government agencies and other regional organizations. The collaborative is
currently working on expanding its membership, developing a work program, and hosting a
3

The mean higher high water (MHHW) mark is the average of the higher of the two high tides per day over a 19
year period called the National Tidal Datum Epoch.

10

webinar series. Seattle was recently selected as a pilot community under the National
Academies Resilient America Roundtable program, which convenes experts from the academic,
public, and private sectors to design or catalyze activities that build or enhance communities'
resilience. As part of this program, Seattle will develop resilience strategies focused on equity
and transportation. Seattle will coordinate these efforts with the regional collaborative. PSRC’s
Transportation 2040 Update will occur in 2018, and PSRC is working to expand its previous
climate change white paper with information on expected impacts, current adaptation efforts
around the region, and economic resiliency. PSRC staff are also working to communicate the
importance of climate resiliency to its board and other decision-makers, which can be
challenging given that this is a relatively new topic and faces many competing priorities.
Climate Resilience: A Southeast Florida Perspective – James Cromar, Broward Metropolitan
Planning Organization
Four counties in Southeast Florida (Palm Beach, Broward, Miami-Dade and Monroe) collaborate
on climate adaptation planning through the Southeast Florida Regional Climate Change
Compact. These counties have coordinated on a FHWA climate change resilience pilot project,
long range planning related to sea level rise, and emergency actions. Southeast Florida faces
many climate impacts, including sea level rise, storm surge, increasing temperatures, inland
flooding, and a rising water table. The FHWA pilot project was developed to build upon existing
vulnerability assessments, minimize the impacts of extreme weather events and sea level rise
on the regional transportation network, develop tools that integrate climate change adaptation
goals into the transportation decision making process, and prepare a climate change adaptation
model for other public transportation agencies.
As part of the pilot project, the Compact conducted a vulnerability assessment for the regional
road network and the Tri Rail network. Vulnerability scores were calculated based on
sensitivity, exposure, and adaptive capacity, and the assets most vulnerable to flooding were
identified for each county. The Compact is now working to integrate climate and vulnerability
data into decision-making through transportation planning and prioritization, the rehabilitation
of existing facilities in high risk areas, and changes to operations and maintenance.
Communities within the region are also beginning to develop adaptation strategies that address
some of the risks and vulnerable assets identified in the pilot.

ATLANTA-AREA PRESENTATIONS
Several presentations provided participants with information on climate resilience work that is
happening in Atlanta outside of the transportation sector. Presenters covered the topics of
municipal resilience strategies, green infrastructure, and the impacts of climate change on
water utilities.
City of Atlanta Climate Action Plan and Resilience Plan – Stephanie Stuckey Benfield and Jairo
Garcia, Mayor’s Office of Sustainability, City of Atlanta
Atlanta was the first city in Georgia to develop a Climate Action Plan, which it did in 2015. The
city’s Climate Action Plan has a goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 80 percent of
2009 levels by 2040, and the city is working to meet this goal through initiatives like improving
energy efficiency in buildings and promoting renewable energy and electric vehicles. Now,
Atlanta is working to improve climate resilience as well. In May 2016 Atlanta was selected as
one of the Rockefeller Foundation’s 100 Resilient Cities, and through this program will receive
funding to hire a Chief Resilience Officer, expertise to develop a resilience strategy, and access
to partners, technologies, and services.
Atlanta is considering resilience to both climate change and other stressors. The city held a
workshop in 2015 with experts from various sectors and identified the following major
vulnerabilities that threaten the city’s resilience: infrastructure failure and aging infrastructure,
inequality, terrorism and cyber-attacks, transportation, rainfall flooding, droughts and water
shortage, and food security. Moving forward, the city will hold additional workshops to gather
input from the public on these vulnerabilities and will develop a resilience strategy to address
them.
Green Infrastructure and Resilience – Robert Reed, Southface
The Southface Green Infrastructure and Resilience Institute (GIRI) works to provide training and
certification to regional professionals to install and maintain green infrastructure. In addition to
its role in workforce development, GIRI also aims to educate the public on the benefits of green
infrastructure. Green infrastructure can address climate risks by reducing negative impacts of
extreme weather events and sewer overflows. It can also have economic and social benefits
through creating green spaces, parks, and other amenities in disinvested and impoverished
areas. Green infrastructure provides an example of tactical, small-scale resilience, in contrast to
the major infrastructure projects that are typically considered when addressing vulnerability to
climate impacts.
Metro Water District Climate Utility Resiliency Study – Danny Johnson, Metropolitan North
Georgia Water Planning District, Atlanta Regional Commission
Metropolitan North Georgia Water Planning District (Metro Water District) is staffed by ARC
and includes 15 counties and 93 cities in the region. The Metro Water District conducts
planning related to water supply and conservation, stormwater, wastewater, and watershed
management. The Metro Water District recently conducted a Utility Climate Resilience Study
12

with the goal of assessing the potential vulnerability of water resources and related
infrastructure given potential climate conditions in the future. The purpose of the study was
not to predict future climate conditions or the likelihood that certain conditions will occur, but
rather to identify climate conditions that would pose risks if they did occur.
The Metro Water District developed five representative scenarios of possible future climate
conditions based on global climate models: hot/wet, hot/dry, warm/wet, warm/dry, and a
middle scenario between the other four. It then identified the water demand, water supply,
and water quality impacts of these climate scenarios. Metro Water District also evaluated
infrastructure vulnerability, including the vulnerability of wastewater treatment plants to the
various climate scenarios. The overall findings from this study were that the most severe
climate impacts would occur in a hot/dry scenario, while the highest risk to infrastructure
would occur in a hot/wet scenario. Recommendations from the study include for the Metro
Water District to establish climate tracking protocols and identify trigger levels for adaptive
measures, as well as to implement preemptive adaptation measures such as green
infrastructure and drought management plans.

KEY TAKE-AWAYS FROM DISCUSSION
The peer exchange included three dedicated discussion sessions, as well as time for questions
and discussion after most presentations. The major topics and themes raised in the discussion
are presented below.
Climate impacts
Although much of the work on transportation and climate change impacts to date has focused
on sea level rise and coastal storms, participants discussed other climate impacts that their
communities are facing and for which they are preparing. One impact that some areas,
including Atlanta, are facing is the dual problem of more severe precipitation events that cause
flooding and longer periods between precipitation events, leading to drought. Heat is also a
major concern for the transportation sector, both through its direct impact on infrastructure
(pavement, rail, etc.) but also through its impact on the electricity supply and on the people
using the transportation system. The social impacts of climate change also affect the
transportation sector. For example, some non-coastal areas are considering whether they will
see an increase in migration from coastal areas as a result of sea level rise, and the impacts on
the transportation system that this migration could cause.
Data collection
In order to conduct a vulnerability assessment, there is a need for data on climate impacts.
Agencies face tradeoffs in deciding what climate data or modeling to use. Tools are available for
downscaling global climate data to a given region. However, this data may not consider all
climate risks or recognize all local geographic features that may affect climate impacts. On the
other hand, it is costly for agencies to conduct their own climate model downscaling; this may
only be cost-effective for large jurisdictions or for those with a low risk tolerance, where
accurate and detailed climate data is essential for designing solutions. In addition, state
agencies may be more equipped than MPOs to conduct climate model downscaling, and then
can provide this data to jurisdictions within their state. For example, Maryland DOT/SHA and
Massachusetts DOT collected climate data and conducted modeling and/or vulnerability
assessments, and provided the results to other jurisdictions.
Building support for resilience
A major theme of the discussion was building support for resilience among decision-makers.
Participants found this especially challenging in places where the state government leadership
is not focused on or is opposed to addressing climate change. Participants suggested the
following strategies for building support for climate resilience:
 Conduct a cost-benefit analysis and make an economic argument for investing in
resilience.


Discuss the climate risks to public health or the health benefits that investing in
resilience can bring. Studies have shown that reframing climate risks with a health lens
can motivate people to take action.
14



Add a climate resilience component into transportation projects that are currently being
planned and designed. Although this will add somewhat to the cost of the project, the
incremental cost for resilience improvements will be lower than with a standalone
project.



Reframe climate resilience with a different name (e.g., hurricane planning).



Identify climate impacts that a community is already facing and frame investments in
resilience as a way to address these.



Use Federal policies as a justification for investing in resilience. For example, the Council
of Environmental Quality’s guidance encourages looking at climate change impacts in
the National Environmental Policy Act process, and the FAST Act requires consideration
of resilience and natural disasters in state and metropolitan transportation planning.

Participants also noted that even in states that are not focused on climate resilience, MPOs still
have flexibility to assess climate risks and incorporate the results into the transportation
planning and project prioritization processes.
Funding
Participants discussed the need for funding to mainstream resilience into transportation
decision-making, and potential sources for this funding. One challenge is that while
interventions that build resilience typically save organizations money in the long term, such
activities cost money in the short term, and transportation agencies need to find the funding to
support the additional expenditures. Similarly, the benefits of many resilience interventions are
felt throughout a region, not just in the transportation sector; however, the costs for
transportation projects are borne solely by the transportation agency. Transportation agencies
need to figure out where to draw the line for quantifying the benefits when doing a costbenefit analysis.
Participants also discussed insurance and whether transportation infrastructure can be insured
so that the government is not fully fiscally responsible for replacing a piece of infrastructure
when it is damaged by severe weather. For example, MassDOT insured the Central
Artery/Tunnel. Participants raised the concern that insuring transportation assets could cause a
tendency to remain in vulnerable areas and rebuild rather than moving assets or improving
their resilience to climate impacts.
Regional and cross-sectoral collaboration
Participants noted the value of working with other agencies and jurisdictions on assessing
climate impacts and planning for resilience. Transportation agencies can partner with water
utilities, health departments, or other sectors to gather climate data and assess risks. Even
within one MPO, there is value in communicating climate-related work, as other departments
may also be working in this area and there may be opportunities for collaboration. For example,
within ARC both the transportation and water resource divisions are working on climate
resilience. There are also benefits to working on resilience through regional collaboration, such
15

as the Southeast Florida Regional Climate Compact, or the compact that is being developed in
the Puget Sound region.
Participants also discussed the need for expanding resilience beyond a focus on infrastructure.
Resilience should also address the people using the infrastructure and how climate change may
affect their behavior while using the transportation system. Some participants also raised the
need for resilience to consider equity and take an environmental justice perspective.
Resilience and the planning process
Although most of the state DOTs and MPOs that participated in the peer exchange had
assessed their transportation system’s vulnerability to climate change, progress on integrating
these results into the planning process and implementing resiliency plans is still in its early
stages. Participants discussed ways to incorporate climate resilience into the planning process.
One challenge is that resilience competes with other major priorities. In addition, in areas that
are currently experiencing the effects of climate change, some amount of climate funding
needs to be dedicated to getting the system up and running in an emergency, rather than to
planning for projects that build resilience.
Agencies may be able to integrate resilience into actions that they are doing anyway at a lower
incremental cost. For example, for assets that have a long service life, such as a bridge or a
tunnel, agencies should consider building climate resilience into the design of the asset from
the beginning. In contrast, there are certain actions that are done frequently enough (e.g.,
pavement design) for which climate-proofing in the short-term can be postponed.
State and MPO needs
FHWA will be developing resources and information to help state DOTs and MPOs meet the
resilience requirements in the FAST Act. Participants suggested several resources that would
help them integrate resilience into the transportation planning process:


Suggestions of performance measures related to resilience that could help agencies
consider climate change in the project prioritization process.



Resources for conducting an economic analysis or cost-benefit analysis of resilience
strategies.



A “menu” of adaptation and resiliency strategies.



Assistance for agencies that do not have any experience with climate resilience,
including suggestions for climate data sources.

FAQ: Emergency Relief Program and Resilience
Q: Can FHWA emergency relief program funds be used to rebuild a damaged highway in a
manner that can prevent damage from future extreme weather events?
A: Yes, if consistent with current standards or if it would save the FHWA emergency relief
program money over time. (FHWA ER Program Manual p24)
Consistent with current standards
Repaired facilities may be rebuilt to current geometric
and construction standards, without being considered
a betterment. For example, a repaired length of
roadway may have an improved waterway opening
that results from following current standards. As
another example, a State may be using more current
precipitation data from NOAA Atlas 14 rather than an
older data set that may have been used when the
facility was originally designed. Also, some states now
require incorporating information on future conditions
into transportation planning and project development
processes. For instance, Caltrans requires considering
sea level rise in planning of coastal transportation
facilities.

Example from Colorado: Improve resilience by bringing up
to current standards.

September 2013 flooding in Colorado washed out this stretch of
US 36 between Lyons and Estes. The segment was reconstructed
to be more resilient to future floods by shifting the road a few
feet further from the river onto bedrock, and using grouted
riprap and native vegetation to stabilize the riverbank. The work
was eligible for and funded with FHWA Emergency Relief funds.
It brought the road up to current geometric design standards
calling for 6 foot shoulders (pre-flood there were minimal
shoulders). Colorado DOT worked in close partnership with the
Central Federal Lands Highway Division and the FHWA Colorado
Division Office on this project. Photo Credit: CO DOT

Save the FHWA emergency relief program money
over time
In general, FHWA emergency relief funds are provided
to restore a facility to its pre-disaster condition.
However, in some circumstances, restoring the facility
to its pre-disaster condition would leave it vulnerable
to repeat damage, costing the FHWA emergency relief
program more than if the facility had been rebuilt with
protective features. In fact, transportation law
requires States to consider alternatives for facilities
repeatedly requiring repair with FHWA emergency relief funds. 1

Adding protective features is considered economically justified under the FHWA emergency relief program if:
Cost of protective feature < probability of damage within facility lifetime * cost of damage that would be
incurred by FHWA emergency relief program.
Note that for the economic justification, only costs to the FHWA emergency relief program are included. Other costs,
such as cost of traveler delay or reduced economic activity are not included. The State must submit an economic
analysis to the FHWA Division office and the Division office must approve it in order for the protective feature to be
eligible for FHWA emergency relief funds.

1

Sec. 1315(b) of Pub. L. 112–141 (MAP-21) as implemented in 23 CFR 667

Examples of betterments that have been approved include:
o raising roadway grades,
o relocating roadways,
o stabilizing slide areas and slopes,
o installing riprap,
o lengthening or raising bridges to increase waterway openings,
o deepening channels,
o increasing the size or number of drainage structures,
o replacing culverts with bridges,
o providing scour countermeasures at bridges, and
o adding spur dikes.
Example from Texas: Economic justification for betterment to improve resilience.

Replacement structure under construction.

In 2015, water cresting over the Denison Dam spillway washed away the existing pipe culvert and roadway surface of SH 91 at
Shawnee Creek. The culvert has been overtopped multiple times during its lifespan. It was previously washed out during flooding
in 1990 and repaired at a cost of $882,000. After the 2015 flooding, Texas DOT conducted life cycle economic analysis of two
alternatives – 1) replace in kind; and 2) replace with a bridge.
Alternative 1 entails installing a 80 ft long, 5 – 12 ft diameter barrel Corrugated Metal Pipe (CMP) culvert spaced 4 ft apart.
Alternative 2 entails a 305 ft concrete span-bridge to accommodate the historic extreme event (6/1/15) of 90,000 cfs. It also entails
raised approach ways to the bridge, heavier columns with tie beams, extensive riprap around the abutments for scour protection,
shear key design to secure the superstructure to the substructure during overtopping, and rail that will allow water to pass through.
Alternative 1 (replace in kind) would cost $1.0 million, but likely require replacement approximately every 25 years over the 100
year lifespan. Alternative 2 would cost $1.7 million, but would likely last the full 100 year lifespan, with $152,000 rehabilitation at
the 60 year point. The analysis used standard discount and inflation rates to calculate present costs. It found that Alternative 2
would have lower cost over the lifespan.
Based on the analysis, the Texas FHWA Division certified the betterment as economically justified and the cost was covered by the
Emergency Relief program. In addition to saving money in reconstruction costs, Alternative 2 also saves $5.9 million in road user
delay costs over time.

Example from North Carolina: NC 12

What if it would not save the FHWA emergency relief program
money over time but the State would still like to include additional
protective features?
Even if rebuilding the facility would not save the FHWA emergency
relief program money over time, a State may still decide to rebuild
more resiliently using other funds because it may be cost beneficial
from a broader perspective. For instance, adding protective
features might prevent disruption to travel and economic activity
that carry benefits not included in the more narrow analysis of cost
savings to the FHWA emergency relief program alone. States may
use their regularly apportioned Federal-aid funds for the
incremental cost to protect the asset where the betterment cannot
be justified with FHWA emergency relief funds.
Proactive approach carries benefits
Rather than waiting for a disaster to damage a facility, a proactive
approach protects the traveling public, prevents damage, and saves
money. While the FHWA emergency relief program does not
provide funding for a proactive approach, other FHWA programs do.
For instance, planning and research funds can be used to conduct a
vulnerability assessment and analysis of adaptation options. Regular
FHWA program funds can be used for activities to plan, design, and
construct highways to adapt to current and future climates and
extreme weather events (see memo).

Hurricane Irene in 2012 breached this section of
Pea Island on the Outer Banks of North Carolina,
washing out a segment of NC 12. The breach is in
an area known as the “S-Curves” which have a
history of ER eligible damages. This area has been
repaired eight times since 1998. Replacing the
segment in kind was not practical given the
severity of the breach. The most practical solution
was to build a bridge. A bridge would be
consistent with Section 404 permit requirements.
Without a bridge, frequent beach nourishment
would be required. NCDOT decided to address the
long term issues of this area through a longer
bridge than required to just bridge the breach. A
longer bridge allows for future migration of the
breach as well as shore line erosion. The portion
of the project that would have been needed to
bridge the existing breach was funded by ER: 0.71
miles of the 2.11 mile project (34% of project is ER
eligible). The rest of the project was eligible for
other federal and state funding. Photo Credit: Tom
MacKenzie, US FWS.

A proactive approach involves the following steps:
1. Conduct a vulnerability assessment. Using FHWA’s
Vulnerability Assessment Framework, determine which
assets are most vulnerable and prioritize action.
2. Integrate into transportation system planning. Incorporate
the results of the vulnerability assessment into the long range transportation plan such that decisions on siting
new transportation facilities and allocating funds to rehabilitate or protect assets take into account relative
climate risks in addition to other community needs and considerations. For instance, in Tampa, FL the
Hillsborough MPO included climate resilience analysis in their transportation plan, identifying adaptation actions
that would cost $31 million, but avoid $265 million in losses.
3. Incorporate into engineering design processes. When designing new highways or rehabilitating older assets,
evaluate future climate impacts on the structures and consider design changes as appropriate. FHWA resources
include the 11-step process for transportation facility adaptation assessments, Hydraulic Engineering Circular 25,
Vol. 2: Highways in the Coastal Environment: Assessing Extreme Events, and HEC-17: Highways in the Riverine
Environment.
4. Incorporate into asset management. Incorporate information on vulnerability into asset management in order
to include adaptive action in regular maintenance and in rehabilitation of assets. NCHRP25-25(94): Integrating
extreme Weather into Transportation Asset Management Plans provides helpful information.
Over the past several years, FHWA has partnered with many DOTs and MPOs to respond proactively by assessing
vulnerabilities and analyzing adaptation options (see pilots).

Dear Colleague:
The increased frequency and severity of disasters continue to tax the personnel, resources and capabilities of
State and local departments of transportation. Whether it’s Transportation Systems Management and
Operations (TSMO), maintenance, emergency managers, infrastructure or planning offices – all must respond
and adapt to what has become the new reality – one that incorporates the impacts of climate change into the
decision making process.
Though transportation agencies have made significant advances in mainstreaming TSMO and maintenance
into their core business processes in the past decade, climate change poses a risk to continuing TSMO and
maintenance improvements and threatens to erode the public trust in a safe, reliable infrastructure. This is
captured in the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) Order issued in December 2014, in compliance
with 2013 Executive Order 13653, Preparing the United States for the Impacts of Climate Change.
The challenge in developing this primer, Climate Change Adaptation Guide, reflects the challenge inherent in
understanding climate change and its impacts on transportation as we know it, i.e., finding ways to help very
different and diverse sets of stakeholders understand the benefits of reaching across institutional divides in
order to work together to achieve common objectives.
The audience for the primer includes TSMO and maintenance program managers, emergency managers,
planners and supervisors involved in all operational aspects that are likely to be affected by climate change.
The content features the following:
• Context and Rationale for Adapting to Climate Change,
• What’s Already Being Done,
• Steps to Adapt TSMO and Maintenance Programs to Climate Change, and
• How to Get Started.
We look forward to receiving your feedback, reactions, and experiences in implementing these concepts.

This guide provides information and resources to help transportation management, operations, and
maintenance staff incorporate climate change into their planning and ongoing activities. It is intended
for practitioners involved in the day-to-day management, operations, and maintenance of surface
transportation systems at State and local agencies. The guide assists State departments of transportation
(DOTs) and other transportation agencies in understanding the risks that climate change poses and actions
that can help reduce those risks. Incorporating climate change considerations into how agencies plan
and execute their transportation system management and operations (TSMO) and maintenance programs
helps the agency become more resilient to unanticipated shocks to the system. Adjustments to TSMO and
maintenance programs—ranging from minor to major changes—can help to minimize the current and
future risks to effective TSMO and maintenance.

I. Introduction to this Guide
Ensuring safety, reliability, and mobility guides the functioning of department of transportation (DOT)
transportation systems management and operations (TSMO) and maintenance programs around the
country. With the infrastructure mostly built out, and in many cases reaching the end of its lifespan, the
emphasis on TSMO and maintenance has continued to grow at both State and local levels.
Transportation agencies have made significant advances in mainstreaming TSMO and maintenance into
their core business processes over the last decade. Investments in technology and systems for traffic
monitoring and management, traffic incident management, and to provide traveler information have
supported the capability of agencies to monitor, respond to, and communicate conditions to travelers.
Similar improvements in maintenance management have occurred with use of material management
systems, improved maintenance and construction strategies, and more robust asset management techniques.
Climate change poses a risk to continuing improvements in this area and threatens to erode the public trust
in a safe, reliable infrastructure.1 DOTs are already observing and responding to the impacts of climate
change. Infrequent but extreme weather events (e.g., floods, hurricanes, Southern snowfalls) are becoming
more frequent, and long-term climatological trends are slowly but inexorably changing how transportation
systems will need to be planned, designed, operated, and maintained.2
Transportation Systems Management and Operations (TMSO), Maintenance, and Climate
Change
State department of transportation (DOT) TSMO and Maintenance Programs are vulnerable to climate
change. Climate change increases uncertainty around planning for extreme weather events, since the past
is no longer a reliable predictor of the future. Climate changes could result in:

 Loss of roadway capacity.
 Loss of alternative routes.
 Loss of situational awareness (due to power/communications outages).
 Inability to evacuate.
 Loss of service life (due to faster deterioration).
 Increased safety risk.
 Loss of economic productivity.
 Reduced mobility.

Climate change risks are as yet not well-understood by TSMO and maintenance groups. Most of the
discussion around climate risks has been at a long-term planning level or from an infrastructure design
standpoint. Consequently, adapting to climate change is still new to the operating divisions within the
DOT. Many agencies are, nevertheless, finding that the approaches and practices that made them
successful operators and maintainers of facilities are not adequate—or at least need to be revisited—with
this change in climate. More frequent events, unusual phenomenon, and changes in long-standing patterns
combined with steadily increasing funding and workforce pressures put agencies at a crucial juncture on
how to plan for effective operations and maintenance.
Incorporating climate change considerations into how agencies plan and execute their TSMO and
maintenance programs helps the agency become more resilient to unanticipated shocks to the system.
Adjustments to TSMO and maintenance programs—ranging from minor to major changes—can help to
minimize current and future risks to effective maintenance and operations.
This guide provides information and resources to help DOT TSMO and maintenance staff incorporate
climate change into their planning and ongoing activities. It will assist State DOTs and other transportation
agencies to understand the risks that climate change poses and actions that can help reduce those risks.
Although there is continually new information emerging about anticipated risks and strategies to address
them, there is sufficient information to begin a more concerted effort to evaluate programs and begin to
make or plan to make adjustments today.

• Over the last 20 years, we have gotten really
good at managing winter storms. We will
deal with whatever nature throws at us.
Do I need to plan for climate change?
• My last few summers have resulted in a lot
of delays in construction due to the heat.
Should I change how I bid out my projects?
• Over the last 20 years, we’ve never had an ice
storm, and I don’t typically budget for ice
removal equipment. We got one last year.
Should I invest?
• My maintenance budgets are typically
insufficient, and I end up going over each
year. How can I plan ahead and better use
my limited resources?
• We worked well together during Hurricane
Sandy, but there were still a lot of challenges.
What will help us be better prepared?

Figure 2. Graph. Overlapping Responsibilities of Different Transportation Agency Offices.

A. Who Should Use this Guide?
This guide is meant for practitioners involved in the day-to-day management, operation, and maintenance
of surface transportation systems at State and local agencies. Climate change will affect different offices
and their varying responsibilities in different ways. As shown in Figure 2, some responsibilities among
this staff are also overlapping and will require coordination. For example, DOT emergency management
staff and TSMO staff need to coordinate during an emergency to provide accurate and up-to-date traveler
information. In some DOTs, staff may serve both a TSMO and maintenance function. All staff might have
a role in major emergencies. In a majority of functional areas, TSMO and maintenance depends on the
collaboration between multiple agencies.
Unless otherwise specified, the content in the guide is applicable to all:
 State and local DOT TSMO and maintenance managers.
 State and local DOT planning staff.
 Metropolitan planning organization (MPO) staff.
 State and local DOT emergency management staff.

B. How Will this Guide Help Agencies Adapt?
The guide provides the rationale and specific guidance for integrating the capability for climate change
adaptation and extreme weather response into TSMO and maintenance programs. It also articulates why
doing so will lead to greater sustainability.

3

In laying out both the need for integration of adaptation into decision making and approaches to do so, this
guide also takes a first step toward beginning to establish a consistency of language and practice that will
facilitate much-needed collaboration and coordinated action across operating groups within and outside
the agency.
The guide provides resources to help agencies:
 Self-evaluate where practices need to be altered to enhance resiliency to climate change.
 Identify what changes need to be made.
 Assess the benefits and co-benefits of making those changes.
 Map out the changes in capabilities that need to be taken to implement them.

C. What this Guide Does Not Cover
The guide is a first effort to provide guidance on how to adapt TSMO and maintenance programs to
climate change. This is a quickly evolving field as evidenced by the rapidly emerging research by top-level
national and international agencies (e.g., United Nations, National Academies). There are still many
knowledge gaps in terms of adapting practices, including risk management and probabilistic decision
making. This document reflects what is known today, but does not answer all the questions that
practitioners are certain to raise.
The guide also does not provide guidance on related topics that are better described in other documents (e.g.,
how to respond during extreme or adverse weather). As mentioned above, this guide is focused on helping
agencies do the “up-front” work to prepare for addressing climate change and extreme weather events.

D. How to Use this Guide
The guide provides context, an overview of steps, and specific resources to help DOTs get started to adapt
TSMO, maintenance and emergency management programs to climate change. Users may come to the
guide with varying levels of familiarity with the content and issues presented herein. It is, thus, designed
so that the Table of Contents can be used to jump to any section in the guide where users find content
relevant to their specific needs. Of particular note:
 Section IV describes the general planning components needed to adapt a TSMO and maintenance
program for climate change.
 Blue text boxes throughout the guide (titled “Getting Started”) contain specific resources to help
agencies get started with adaptation, such as checklists and other resources.
 Green text boxes throughout the guide (titled “Examples from the Field”) provide lessons learned and
best practices from around the country. These examples help to illustrate the more general guidance
provided and highlight the diversity of issues and approaches to addressing them.

II. Context and Rationale for Adapting to
Climate Change
A. Federal Highway Administration Action on Climate Change
Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) recognizes that climate change and extreme weather events
pose a significant challenge to the safety, reliability, effectiveness, and sustainability of the national
transportation system. In 2014, FHWA issued a directive that establishes FHWA policy on preparedness
and resilience to climate change and extreme weather events, in compliance with Executive Order 13653,
Preparing the United States for the Impacts of Climate Change, issued in 2013. The FHWA directive
provides several ways in which “FHWA will integrate consideration of the risks of climate change and
extreme weather event impacts and adaptation responses, into the delivery and stewardship of the Federalaid and Federal Lands Highway programs,” including encouraging State departments of transportation
(DOTs), metropolitan planning organizations (MPOs) tribal governments, and others to develop costeffective strategies to minimize climate and extreme weather risks.3
FHWA began activities to address climate change in the early 2000s with several white papers followed by
in-depth studies on the impacts of both climate variability and climate change in the Gulf Coast as well as
sea level rise on the Atlantic Coast. FHWA’s next steps to address climate change were to develop tools
and information that could be used by State DOTs and MPOs to assess their vulnerabilities to climate
change. FHWA also continues to analyze strategies that can help improve resiliency. For additional
information on FHWA’s climate change efforts, see the FHWA web page, "Summary of FHWA Climate
Adaptation Initiatives." 4
The FHWA Order and ongoing research activities are intended to promote transportation system resiliency,
defined as the ability to anticipate, prepare for, and adapt to changing conditions and withstand, respond to,
and recover rapidly from disruptions. Much of the work to date has been focused on assessing
vulnerabilities and considering transportation infrastructure and design adaptation. This guide specifically
focuses on how agencies can reframe TSMO and maintenance programs to increase resilience to the
uncertainty and variability associated with climate change.

B. What is Transportation Systems Management and Operations and
Maintenance?
This guide focuses on two primary transportation functions: 1) transportation systems management and
operations (TSMO) and 2) maintenance. These functions both involve the day-to-day activities that maximize
the use of transportation infrastructure. TSMO refers to an integrated approach of programs, projects, or
services designed to get the safest and most efficient use out of existing and planned infrastructure. TSMO
functions include traffic management, traffic incident management, traveler information services, traffic signal
coordination, transit priority/integration, freight management, work zone management, planned special event
management, road weather management, and active transportation and demand management.
Maintenance activities help to preserve and extend the use of transportation infrastructure and aim at carrying
out day-to-day protective and repair measures to limit degradation due to natural processes (e.g., weather) or
imposed processes (e.g., traffic). Maintenance functions include pavement management, shoulder maintenance,
bridge inspection, vegetation management, road weather management, work zone management, and asset
management.

C. How are Extreme Weather Events and Climate Change Related?
It is important to understand how extreme weather events and climate change are related and how they
differ.5 Changes in climate and weather are linked over the long term, but no single weather event can
specifically be attributed to a changing climate.
 Weather events are defined as the state of the atmosphere in a particular location at a particular time. For
example, rain, temperature, and wind are all aspects of local weather. “Extreme weather events can
include significant anomalies in temperature, precipitation and winds, and can manifest as heavy
precipitation and flooding, heatwaves, drought, wildfires and windstorms (including tornadoes and
tropical storms).” 6
 Climate change refers to any significant change in the measures of climate lasting for an extended
period of time. Climate change includes major variations in temperature, precipitation, or wind
patterns, among other environmental conditions, that occur over several decades or longer. Changes in
climate may manifest as a rise in sea level, as well as increase the frequency and magnitude of extreme
weather events now and in the future.7
Long-term trends in climate are not dependent on any single extreme event. A single large rain event or
even a single wet year may just be a normal fluctuation in weather patterns but changes that are noted year
after year, such as a run of wet years, can be attributed to a larger change in the climate.
Climate change could mean that what was historically a rare weather event becomes increasingly frequent
(possibly shifting from rare to occasional or regular). Consideration of how we respond effectively or not
to the rare extreme events occurring today can provide useful information about how we can and should
respond to increasing future risk. Optimizing for today’s extreme weather events makes our systems more
prepared for the increased frequency of some events that is anticipated under a changing climate. Figure 3
demonstrates the shift in temperatures towards more hot weather and a slight decrease in cold weather.

5

A good discussion of the linkage between extreme weather events and climate change can be found in: D. Huber and J. Gulledge,
“Extreme Weather and Climate Change: Understanding the Link and Managing the Risk,” Science and Impacts Program (Arlington, VA:
Center for Climate and Energy Solutions, 2011). Available at: http://www.c2es.org/publications/extreme-weather-and-climate-change.

D. How Will Climate Change Affect Transportation Systems Management
and Operations and Maintenance?
As climate changes, agencies may have to deal with new weather stressors that require different planning
approaches or responses (e.g., loss of permafrost in Alaska, snow and ice control in Southern states). The
2011 report, Adapting Transportation to the Impacts of Climate Change State of the Practice provided an
overview of the operational impacts associated with climate change.9 These operational impacts include:
 Increase in traffic incident management activities.
 Road and lane closures.
 Reduced (and variable) speed limit.
 Disruption of transit service.
 Road and transit diversions.
 Truck restrictions.
 Work zone management (to accommodate additional lane closures).
The 2013 report, Planning for Systems Management & Operations as part of Climate Change Adaptation,
provides a summary of the anticipated changes to system maintenance (e.g., inspection, frequency of repairs,
need for “quick maintenance” patrols); system operations practices and strategies (e.g., more frequent
diversion to more robust alternate routes); travel behavior (e.g., motivation to use alternate modes of transport
such as transit, biking, or walking); and freight transportation (dynamic or seasonal restrictions for trucks or
rail during times of high heat) needed or likely to occur as a result of anticipated impacts of climate change.10

While TSMO and maintenance programs are often reactive by nature, the accelerating pace and
increasingly unpredictable nature of extreme weather events could place increasing strain on an already
stressed system. Further, agencies may not be optimized for the present; some practices need to be
improved now.
TSMO and maintenance programs will need to take a proactive approach to regularly reevaluate existing
programs and practices in light of new information and criteria (e.g., if preparing for new demands, they
may need to adjust budgets) to ensure they are climate resilient. Opposition to making changes in
operations may exist due to the risk-averse environments under which many State DOTs operate.
Traditionally, this risk aversion has resulted in slow changes in practices and protocols in order to avoid
changing what works. Transportation agencies could be at greater risk, however, if they do not change their
practices rather than if they do. The environment in which they work is changing due to climate change;
risk-averse decision makers should seek to avoid risks by considering climate change in their systems
management and maintenance rather than ignoring it.

E. Why Do Transportation Systems Management and Operations and
Maintenance Programs Need to Adapt to Climate Change?
TSMO and maintenance programs have vital roles to play in adapting to climate change. For many of the
already observed and anticipated weather events related to climate change, TSMO and maintenance
workers as well as the DOT emergency responders with whom they coordinate—who are, in some
instances, DOT maintenance staff—are and will be the public face and the front-line of the response.
Climate change presents a business risk for transportation agencies. Without proactive steps to anticipate
potential changes and respond to them, the ability of agencies to support their core mission could be
compromised.
With climate change comes uncertainty, be it in a greater variability of expected events or unexpected
extreme weather. By not understanding the risk or not assessing the vulnerability of their operations,
agencies can be caught off-guard by an unexpected event leading to significantly degraded capabilities
when they are most needed.
Changes in relatively short duration extreme events often result in the most significant consequences, and
while DOTs may be prepared to respond to these events on an individual basis, the cumulative impact of
more severe and more frequent events may warrant a change in business practices. Longer term changes to
annual or seasonal averages, which are often cited in broad-scale summaries of projected climate change,
cause less immediate impacts but over time can affect practices and costs.
Not all the necessary adjustments to business practices are radical; there are many ways—big and
small—to account for climate change and reduce this business risk. In fact, many TSMO and maintenance
adaptations will be the “low-hanging fruit” to prepare DOTs for climate change, in contrast to changes to
infrastructure design.
Incremental steps toward a more comprehensive program that fully considers how to incorporate potential
climate change impacts will be easier for most agencies to manage than an immediate, full-fledged,
comprehensive overhaul of their existing programs. A phased implementation approach will enable
agencies to adapt their TSMO and maintenance programs to climate change in a planned and systematic
manner. For this to occur, it is necessary to incorporate the needs of climate change and extreme weather
events into the routine policy and practice of TSMO and maintenance at transportation agencies.

8

Adapting TSMO and maintenance programs is largely about improving capability rather than a major
technology development and deployment initiative. Many of the technology elements used to support
safety, congestion mitigation, and traveler information objectives are already in place and there is more on
the way. For example, today Road Weather Information Systems (RWIS), cameras, and other roadside
infrastructure are used extensively by agencies around the country. In the near future, connected vehicle
technologies promise to overcome the barriers of fixed infrastructure and data availability. To adapt to
climate change then, agencies need to consider how these existing capabilities need to evolve to meet the
new and emerging requirements of a changing climate. These may take the form of hardening the
communication links or rethinking the siting of these detection systems. Similarly, other existing
processes for supporting safety and reliability need to be reviewed and supplemented to account for
climate change.

F. Capability Maturity Framework
The American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) and FHWA have
developed a capability maturity framework (CMF) to help DOTs adapt their TSMO programs.11 The CMF
defines six areas of capability that form the supportive foundation for the implementation of TSMO
strategies. As agency capabilities increase from ad-hoc implementation and planning to optimized
practices, agencies will be able to have repeatable processes that are scalable, sustainable, and
mainstreamed.
This guide aligns those actions needed to adapt TSMO and maintenance programs to climate change with
the six areas of the CMF:
 Business processes – including financial (e.g., budgeting) as well as conducting risk analyses and dealing
with uncertainty, planning, programming, and standard operating/implementation procedures.
 Systems and technology – transportation agencies have invested in a wide suite of technology and
management systems to enable them to more efficiently manage weather events within their jurisdiction.
 Performance measurement – including measures definition, data acquisition, analysis, and utilization.
 Culture – including technical understanding, leadership commitment, policy, outreach, and program
authority.
 Organization and workforce – including organizational structure, staff capacity, development, and
retention.
 Collaboration – including internal collaboration and relationships with other public agencies and the
private sector.

G. What's Already Being Done?
The growing awareness that climate change can affect transportation has not yet resulted in widespread
actions to identify and implement strategies to address climate change. Some transportation agencies have
begun to assess vulnerability. Fewer have moved beyond vulnerability assessments and into adaptation
planning. Even fewer have implemented adaptation strategies and begun to evaluate their effectiveness.
Further, more emphasis to date has been on the implications of climate change for infrastructure planning,
design, and engineering with less focus on system management, operations, and maintenance.
The transportation sector is not ahead or behind other sectors in this regard. Changes in climate are often
discussed on a global or regional scale and presented with wide ranges of uncertainty and timescales. It is
challenging to understand what climate change will mean on a local scale and for the timeframe most
relevant to specific decision making processes of interest.

III. Steps to Adapt Transportation
Systems Management and Operations and
Maintenance Programs to Climate Change
A. How Transportation Systems Management and Operations and
Maintenance Work Together on Climate Change
Over the past 10 years, State and local agencies have implemented various transportation systems
management and operations (TSMO) and maintenance strategies to mitigate the impacts of adverse
weather on the transportation system. The strategies run the gamut from plowing and sanding to
coordinated traffic control strategies and regional traveler information. Agencies respond to weather events
through a multi-pronged approach that involves a combination of operational, maintenance, and, at times,
emergency management strategies. Typical strategies used today include motorist alerts, advisories,
warnings (which include roadside active warning systems and pre-trip traveler information systems), speed
restrictions (variable speed limits, for example), vehicle restrictions (truck restrictions during high winds),
route restrictions (road closures), anti-icing/deicing road surface treatments, plowing, and traffic signal
management (weather responsive traffic management). In addition, traffic incident and emergency
management practices provide agencies with the ability to marshal resources effectively to address adverse
weather. Most of these approaches require multi-agency and multi-disciplinary capabilities to be brought
together efficiently before, during, and after the extreme weather event. Traffic incident and emergency
management collectively fall under the area of emergency transportation operations (ETO), which involves
collaboration and coordination between transportation, public safety (fire, rescue, emergency medical
service [EMS]), law enforcement) and emergency management communities.
The roles and responsibilities of TSMO, maintenance, and emergency response managers and staff are
connected and often interdependent in addressing the impacts of extreme weather and climate change on
the transportation system. Each functional group has a unique set of decisions falling across the six areas
of the capability maturity framework (CMF) (described in Section II) that may need to be examined in
adapting to climate change.

11

For example, the managers of maintenance programs will be concerned with decisions involving
pavement rehabilitation needs and methods, bridge maintenance needs and methods, construction and
maintenance work timelines and timeframes, and vegetation control. TSMO12program managers will
need to revisit other decisions such as the types of monitoring equipment and sources, communication
needs, and siting criteria necessary to obtain real-time operational information on the transportation
system and push information out to travelers. Emergency management leaders, in coordination with
operations divisions, will look at adapting operating procedures and resource levels to prepare for
hurricane evacuations or other weather-related emergencies. As is evident, TSMO functions rely on
well-maintained infrastructure, and successful emergency management depends on reliable and
strategically deployed TSMO infrastructure (e.g., traffic signals, contra-flow lanes, variable message sign
(VMS), cameras, road weather information stations), TSMO staff, and fine-tuned operating procedures
that can be leveraged during emergencies. The same holds true for maintenance, its infrastructure, and
the linkage between maintenance and emergency management.
The link between transportation operations and emergency management varies depending on the scale of
the event. During major, catastrophic events emergency management agencies have control of the response
and transportation operations. During less extreme events, the departments of transportation (DOTs)
maintain control over the highways and major arterials. This difference will be important to consider when
DOTs plan actions to address climate change risks in the short and long term. Figure 4 illustrates that as
the level of severity of the incident increases, the number of agencies involved grows beyond the DOT to
include public safety and emergency management agencies. The increase in severity also indicates that a
greater level of collaboration and communication between agencies and functions is required.

B. Overview of an Operations Adaptation Framework
The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) has developed and tested a Climate Change and Extreme
Weather Vulnerability Assessment Framework (“the Framework”) (see Figure 5) which consists of a report13
and an online virtual framework (see Figure 6),14 which serve both as a guide and a collection of resources
for use by transportation professionals when analyzing the impacts of climate change and extreme weather
on transportation infrastructure. Its purpose is to identify key considerations, questions, and resources that
can be used to design and implement a climate change vulnerability assessment. To date, the Framework
has been tested by 24 pilot sites and has undergone a series of refinements as a result of the real-world
findings. The pilots have also contributed to the plentiful body of lessons learned and example resources
that are linked to the virtual version of the Framework.

The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) Virtual Framework
FHWA has developed a broad set of resources to help transportation agencies prepare for climate
change. The "Virtual Framework for Vulnerability Assessment" website houses resources for State and
local transportation agencies (see Figure 6). The Virtual Framework breaks the vulnerability
assessment process into six modules. Each module contains step-by-step guidance, video testimonials
from professionals sharing lessons on their experience, case studies related to the framework step,
links to resources related to the step, and tools to help a user complete the step.

Figure 6. Screenshot. Federal Highway Administration Virtual Framework
for Vulnerability Assessment (Module 2 shown).
This guide is intended to complement the resources on the Virtual Framework and provide targeted
guidance to staff in the transportation systems management and operations (TSMO) and maintenance
domains. Throughout this document, the Virtual Framework is referenced as appropriate, in cases
where guidance (e.g., where to find climate data) is not operations-specific.
The Framework, originally developed with an infrastructure planning and design focus, provides the
organizing principle for understanding adaptation needs from an operations and maintenance perspective
as well.
Consistent with the Framework the primary components of this guide include:
 Define objectives and scope.
 Assess vulnerability.
 Integrate climate change considerations into decision making.
 Monitor, revisit, and develop new objectives.
While the emphasis of this guide is on concrete actions DOTs can take to integrate climate change into
decision making, it is critical to also define the scope of adaptation efforts and assess vulnerabilities to
inform the development of adaptation strategies. Figure 7 illustrates how TSMO and maintenance
groups can use the Framework to identify and implement appropriate strategies for their unique
conditions and locations.

C. Define Scope
It is important to articulate the objectives of the adaptation effort up front and identify the anticipated
changes in climate that are most relevant to your agency. Together, these steps frame the scope of the
planning effort and drive the details required; they help minimize data collection and analysis activities that
would ultimately be extraneous to the desired objectives.

1. Articulate Program Goals and Operations Objectives
TSMO and maintenance offices within agencies have long been driven by goals and objectives largely
around safety, levels of service, and reliability. DOTs need to adapt to climate change to ensure they can
continue to meet program goals.
Program goals and operations objectives may require some updates when anticipated climate changes are
taken into account. These updates may be only subtle shifts in agency focus, but should aim to define
what must be achieved to ensure resilient operations. Agencies should consider what levels of performance
are expected during adverse weather (which may become more frequent or intense under a changing
climate) and what levels of disruption are tolerable. Demand-oriented goals and objectives (e.g., the role of
the agency. in serving the surge in demand that may be expected) need to be defined as well as the
expectations for restoration of services and travel.
15

Getting Started: Obtaining Buy-In
A critical component to any organizational change is developing support for that change among key
decision makers and stakeholders. Adapting a transportation systems management and operations
(TSMO) or maintenance program to increase climate change resiliency requires gathering support
among program management, agency decision makers, program staff, and others involved in the
TSMO or maintenance program activities. The level of buy-in required will depend on the scale of
change desired. Below are several recommendations for gathering support for adapting a TSMO or
maintenance program to prepare for the current and potential future impacts of climate change:
 Make the business case for resilience.
• Start by identifying any current issues in operating and maintaining the transportation system
as a result of extreme weather events or noticeable changes in climate.
• Use FHWA documents, such as the Regional Climate Change Effects: Useful Information for
Transportation Agencies, to gather key reasons to be concerned about climate change and what
the projected effects are of climate change locally.15
• Find a model or example to strengthen the case. The Federal Highway Admintration (FHWA)
has several case studies available.
 Engage staff and leadership throughout the department of transportation (DOT) early and often,
especially in the vulnerability assessment and brainstorming of adaptation strategies.
 Establish clear roles and responsibilities for individuals within the organization and determine
systems for accountability.
 Improve integration of TSMO, maintenance, and emergency management into DOT planning for
climate change.
Agencies should also develop more specific, outcome-based operations objectives for the program goals.
These operations objectives should be refined and tied to specific performance measures when working
through Sections III.D. Assess Vulnerability and III.E Integrate into Decision Making (and once the user
has a better understanding of realistic expectations that take into account future changes in climate).15

2. Identify Key Climate Variables
Changes in climate and extreme weather events will not be uniform throughout the world or even
throughout the United States. It is important to identify the climate stressors or extreme weather events
(e.g., increase in extreme heat, more frequent heavy precipitation, increased precipitation variability,
drought, flooding, sea level rise, higher storm surges, increase in wildfire probability) that: (1) could
occur locally; and (2) could affect local TSMO and maintenance programs. Examples of the geographic
diversity of climate impacts can be seen in Figure 8. A complete set of resources for identifying local
climate changes is available as part of Module 2 of FHWA’s Virtual Framework for Vulnerability
Assessment.16 Once the regional climate stressors of concern have been identified, Section III of this
document explains how to refine DOTs understanding of the scale and impacts of those climate stressors
on TSMO and maintenance.

3. Develop Information on Decisions
Sensitive to Climate Change
As discussed in Section III.D.2, information on the
past climate and the resultant impacts is useful for
understanding the kinds of weather and climate
effects to which assets and operations are sensitive
and can help to identify thresholds beyond which
future climate effects may affect those assets.

Sensitivity = how an asset or system
fares when it is exposed to an
impact.

Adaptation Framework.

It is also important to look forward and identify decisions that may be climate-sensitive in the future and
which decisions (e.g., standard operating practices, budget allocations) may be based on historical climate
trends that no longer accurately reflect more recent trends (that have shifted due to climate change).
The following is a proposed definition for climate-sensitive decisions:

Decisions are climate-sensitive if their continued effectiveness
could be compromised by projected changes in climatic conditions
(e.g., changes in temperature, precipitation, weather patterns, and
the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events).
TSMO and maintenance decisions that DOTs make on a daily basis are rarely climate-sensitive, because
the implications of those decisions are typically so short-lived that there is not enough time for them to be
compromised by the effects of climate change. Transportation agencies make numerous short-term and
long-term decisions about their TSMO and maintenance programs, however. Potential changes in
extreme weather events or climate variability are relevant to many of these decisions, especially the
decisions agencies make infrequently.

An early step in identifying how DOTs can adapt their TSMO and maintenance programs is to identify
possible entry points—existing decisions that could incorporate climate change considerations in the
future. For example, knowing that there could be more frequent flooding events could change an agency’s
decision about what workforce capabilities are required for the season. Table 1 provides an example of
potential TSMO and maintenance decisions which may be influenced by climate change and extreme
weather. Additional examples and related information are provided in Appendix A – Matrix of ClimateSensitive Decisions. For each decision, the appendix includes a description, how climate stressors affect
the decision, and which climate stressors affect the decision.
Table 1. Example of Climate-Sensitive Decisions.
Climate-Sensitive
Decision Areas

Specific Decisions

Description

1. Planning for future
workforce needs.

Determine the right level of
workforce requirements and
capabilities.

Operating agencies make a variety of
workforce-related decisions, including the
number of staff required, their locations, and
capabilities necessary to monitor, control,
report, and maintain the roadway system.

2. Planning for
operations and
maintenance
investments.

Determine criteria to
prioritize operational
resource investments
(including capital
improvements).

Resource investments may include new capital
improvements for operations and maintenance
such as control systems, field equipment,
vehicles, communications, and power. They
may also include investments for annual
maintenance.

3. Budgeting for
operations and
maintenance.

Determine the appropriate
funding needs and levels on
annual and multi-year basis.

Operating agencies typically are funded on an
annual basis. Funding levels greatly drive the
overall program capabilities and functions.

4. Establishing
realistic objectives.

Set regional operations
objectives for the program.

Effective planning for operations requires a
clear articulation of regional operations
objectives. These objectives define the
response strategies and the performance-based
management required.

Note: Excerpted from Appendix A – Matrix of Climate-Sensitive Decisions.

While day-to-day management of traffic operations might not be particularly sensitive to broader changes
in climate, the planning required to support agile TSMO and maintenance programs may involve more
climate-sensitive decisions. For example, future workforce equipment needs, facility siting, material
procurement, technology deployments, business processes, and institutional arrangements typically span
multiple seasons and even years. The effectiveness of such decisions made today may be compromised by
changes in climate.
The following list of questions can help agencies determine if a decision is climate-sensitive:
 Do climate variables have a direct effect on the decision outcomes? For example, will increases in
precipitation overwhelm current maintenance practices?
 Can climate variables affect the underlying assumptions upon which the decision is founded? For
example, will changes in the climate, such as precipitation, affect traffic levels, which in turn impact
roadway operations and management?
 Is climate likely to change during the time period governed by the decision? Consider long-term, chronic
changes in climate as well as the increased frequency of acute weather events.
• What is the time horizon for planning and implementation?
• How frequently is the decision made?
18

 Is this a single decision moment or a multiple decision moment (i.e., is the decision made once and then
executed or is there room for refinement and adjustment over the course of implementation/operations)?
Includes:
• Financial reversibility (i.e., does the practice represent a cost that cannot be recovered?)
• Foreclosure of other options (i.e., does implementing this practice limit the availability of other practices
in the future?).
In addition, think about whether there are any specific weather thresholds at which the decisions become
sensitive. Linking TSMO and maintenance practices to weather thresholds is a needed step in this process.
To date, these rules have been ad-hoc and not formalized. In the past, experienced supervisors knew what
activities could be scheduled based on weather conditions like precipitation, wind speeds, visibility, and
temperature. There are no standard weather-related practices for maintenance or operations actions. When
there are specific thresholds for weather conditions (e.g., staff cannot work without frequent breaks when
temperatures are above X°F), projections on how those specific variables may change in the future can
help inform planning.

Identifying Weather Sensitivity Thresholds
An important component of understanding how climate change may affect transportation systems
management and operations (TSMO) and maintenance practices is understanding whether there are
specific weather thresholds that affect TSMO and maintenance—and then, whether those thresholds may
change in the future.
The links between weather, TSMO, and maintenance are often well understood at the individual level (e.g.,
maintenance supervisors), but these “rules” are often ad hoc and are rarely documented or formalized.
Consider using the climate change planning process to capture internal guidelines and weather
thresholds. For example, the table below can serve as a “template” for identifying and recording weather
sensitivity thresholds. This is derived for work focused on the Illinois and Iowa departments of
transportation. The Capital Area Metropolitan Planning Organization (CAMPO) in Austin, Texas,
completed a similar exercise to identify sensitivity thresholds as part of their Federal Highway
Administration-funded Climate Resilience Pilot Project.

Using Scenario Planning to Understand Climate Change Vulnerability and Risk
Scenario planning is an approach to planning that is increasingly being used by transportation planning
organizations to make critical decisions in the face of uncertainty. Scenario planning helps stakeholders
answer questions such as what are the policies, strategies, or investments that help us achieve our goals in
light of uncontrollable or unknown future conditions. Scenario planning brings together interagency and
intra-agency stakeholders needed to effectively address an issue and helps them make decisions that are
more robust in a variety of futures. It also helps create a more adaptive, resilient organization or program.
Scenario planning could be used to help make decisions regarding adapting a transportation systems
management and operations (TSMO) or maintenance program for potential climate change impacts.
Scenario planning allows organizations to explore several distinct possible futures that may result from
different paths that climate change may take, analyze the potential consequences, and investigate
alternative TSMO and maintenance strategies to address the issues. The scenario approach formalizes
the consideration of uncertainty in preparing for climate change impacts in a systematic way. Scenario
planning may also aid in helping to set expectations among planners and even the general public on
acceptable levels of system performance under extreme conditions by assessing the trade-offs between
levels of investment and levels of system operation during different levels of severe weather. Finally, the
scenario process might also aid the region in better understanding its areas of susceptibility, thereby
further helping to refine and strategically deploy TSMO and maintenance strategies.
There are models (e.g., Maintenance Decision Support System [MDSS]; Sea, Lake, and Overland Surges
from Hurricanes [SLOSH]) that can be can be used to run extreme future event scenarios. These model
runs could be used to inform a planning process that considers high heat, winter storms, summer storms,
sea level rise, wildfires, or cascading impacts (e.g., power/utility failure, landslides).

D. Assess Vulnerability
The level of vulnerability assessment needed – high-level or detailed, qualitative or quantitative, statewide
or localized, agency-wide or by departments – will vary based on the types of decisions required.
Regardless of the exact process used, the following are key elements of a vulnerability assessment.

1. Document Existing Capabilities
It is important to take a look at current or baseline capabilities (assessing both technical as well as
institutional capability to respond to climate and extreme weather) before seeking to determine
improvements in those capabilities (discussed in Section III.E.4). The CMF provides a useful framework for
assessing and documenting existing institutional capabilities (and will be discussed again later in the context
of determining improvement in capabilities necessary for successful implementation of adaptation
measures). The framework defines capability in terms of six areas that together inform the agency’s overall
ability to respond to changing conditions: business processes, systems and technology, performance
management, culture, organization and workforce, and collaboration. Documenting current capabilities and
identifying where those capabilities fall on the spectrum of ad-hoc implementation to planning for

20

optimized practices will help an agency gain a better sense of how resilient they may already be to climate
change and extreme weather events.

2. Collect and Integrate Data on Past Performance
Examining previous vulnerabilities can be an excellent starting point for thinking about future
vulnerabilities. Common climate change-related TSMO and maintenance program vulnerabilities include:
 Loss of roadway capacity.
 Loss of alternative routes.
 Loss of situational awareness (due to power/communication).
 Inability to evacuate/shelter-in-place.
 Loss of service life (due to faster deterioration, etc.).
 Increased safety risk.
 Loss of economic productivity.
 Reduced mobility.
Internal records or other data on how the system has fared during previous extreme weather events can
provide a rich source of insights into potential future vulnerabilities. Any of the following could be a source
of information about system vulnerabilities:
 Traffic incident reports – Check whether there were any incidents during specific recent extreme
weather events that correspond to the climate stressors under evaluation (e.g., heat waves, heavy rain
events, tropical storms).
 Maintenance records – Check maintenance records for the time surrounding specific recent weather
events.
 After-action reports –These reports, compiled after extreme weather events, describe what happened,
why, and areas for improvement. Mine these reports for information about vulnerabilities for
applicable weather events.
 Emergency reimbursement forms – For declared disasters relevant to the climate stressors under
evaluation, review Federal Emergency Management Administration (FEMA) or other emergency
reimbursement requests to identify the magnitude and scope of damages during past events.
 Staff interviews across departments – On-the-ground staff at DOTs often have deep institutional
knowledge about existing vulnerabilities that may not be well-documented. Asking staff “What keeps
you up at night?” can help facilitate discussion about key system vulnerabilities.19

Mining Agency Institutional Knowledge for Vulnerability Assessments
Washington State DOT (WSDOT) completed a statewide climate change vulnerability assessment in
2011. Their vulnerability assessment focused on asset-level vulnerabilities, but the approach would be
transferrable to transportation systems management and operations (TSMO) and maintenance
vulnerabilities. The WSDOT assessment relied on a series of workshops with WSDOT staff, including
district maintenance supervisors and their staff. They asked “What keeps you up at night?” and had staff
individually rate each asset’s vulnerability on a scale of 1 to 10. Lower scores corresponded to reduced
capacity or temporary operational failure, while higher scores corresponded to complete asset failure.

If possible, build a dataset to correlate past extreme weather disruptions—gathered from the above
sources—with information on the weather conditions associated with the event.
Local National Weather Service (NWS) Forecast Offices (there are 122 nationwide) house “Weather Event
Archives” that can be very useful sources of information on past extreme events.20 It is also important to
share collected information across offices or departments.

Getting Started: Strategies for Documenting Institutional Knowledge
On-the-ground staff at departments of transportation (DOTs) are largely aware of the current weatherrelated problems they face on a regular basis. In addition, they are valuable resources in discussing
hypothetical extreme weather scenarios, and may be able to readily identify potential points of failure.
Below are several possible mechanisms to collect and document the valuable institutional knowledge of
staff, which can then be leveraged to improve planning for transportation systems management and
operations (TMSO) and maintenance in the face of climate change.
 Conduct interviews with staff to document their knowledge of vulnerabilities. Interview questions can
include:
• Recall [a recent severe weather event]. How did that affect your purview?
• When you have advance warning of an extreme [summer storm/winter storm/hurricane/heat
event]:
◦ What responses are triggered? Are those responses tied to any thresholds in event severity
(e.g., only if there is more than 3” of snow)?
◦ What personnel are involved?
◦ What contractors are put on notice in the preparations?
◦ What materials and equipment are put on standby?
•

When the event is over:
∘∘ What inspections/audits are conducted to evaluate impacts?
∘∘ How are corrective actions planned?

 In a workshop setting, have staff place pins or dots on a map of the transportation system to identify
locations with frequent weather-related issues (e.g., flooding, potholes).
 Establish regular debriefs to bring together the department’s cross-cutting (or multi-disciplinary)
teams to discuss weather-related issues. Designate a person to take notes during the meeting and write
down what works well, what does not, and what needs to change to make the system more resilient.
 Establish transition plans for retiring staff. Ask them to write down their regular duties, habits, and
unwritten expertise.

3. Develop Climate Inputs
In addition to gathering information on past weather disruptions and identifying key TSMO and
maintenance weather sensitivities, another important component of a climate change vulnerability
assessment is collecting data, qualitative or quantitative, on how climate stressors are projected to change
locally. The focus should be on identifying how specific weather thresholds identified as currently
affecting TSMO and maintenance activities may change in the future.

20 Historical Weather Event Archives are not always easy to find on NWS Regional Forecast Office web pages, but are usually housed under
the Climate section.
22

Several sources exist to provide information on potential future climate changes, a selection of which are
highlighted in the following text box. See Module 4 of the FHWA Framework21 for additional guidance on
gathering climate inputs.

http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/environment/climate_change/adaptation/adaptation_framework/modules/index.cfm?moduleid=4.

In addition to collecting information on climate projections, many transportation agencies have found it
helpful to collect information on historical weather conditions in order to provide context for the
projections. Examine Road Weather Information System (RWIS) data to help establish the climate record
for the area. All properly sited and maintained weather stations can be a vital part of the climate record,
especially if they have been maintained for longer than 30 years. If RWIS data is not available, data can be
obtained from the local weather station(s) through the National Weather Service.

Understanding Uncertainty
Future climate change is dependent upon the amount of global greenhouse gasses emitted. In the near
term, it is easier to predict emission levels because they will likely be similar to today’s rate of emissions
production given the limited time for society to evolve. It is very difficult to project emission levels out
50 to 90 years into the future because it is not known how our global society will evolve over time (e.g.,
population growth, economic growth, energy use, development of significant technological
advancements, political action mitigating emissions). Thus, the range of plausible future emissions
expands over future time, along with the plausible range of climate responses.

PRESENT

Uncertainty Over Time

DISTANT FUTURE

Figure 9. Diagram. Increase in Uncertainty Over Time.
Near term climate projections have a tighter range of possibilities, while distant climate projections have
wider range of possibilities.
Any projections of future climate conditions are subject to this uncertainty, but that doesn’t have to
prevent agencies from using this information. Scenario planning exercises can help departments of
transportation identify adaptation strategies that increase resilience in a range of potential future
conditions (see text box on page 23).

4. Characterize Impacts and Risks
Synthesize information on potential climate changes, past impacts, and known sensitivities to characterize
possible impacts of climate change on TSMO and maintenance programs.
Determine Outputs
Think about how results will be used to determine what level of information is needed to inform decisions.
Options include:
 Qualitative vulnerability ratings of individual decisions, functions, components, or locations (the level
of detail decided at the outset) – e.g., High, Medium, Low vulnerabilities. In this approach, consider
vulnerability as a function of three components:22
• Exposure – The nature and degree to which a system or asset is exposed to significant climate
variations (i.e., whether and how climate stressors will change).
• Sensitivity – Degree to which an asset or system is affected by exposure (i.e., if all assets were
equally exposed, which would experience the greatest damage?).
• Adaptive Capacity – Ability of a system to adjust, repair, and respond to damage or disruption.
Adaptive capacity may not be applicable or ratable in many cases, so it may be excluded from
vulnerability assessments.
Figure 10 provides an example of a rapid qualitative assessment of the vulnerability of a pavement
maintenance program to increasing temperatures. It assumes that no information is readily available on
adaptive capacity for this rapid assessment (i.e., that more information might need to be gathered to assess
that component if a more detailed assessment is determined to be useful).

 Quantitative vulnerability ratings – Use a quantitative approach to assign vulnerability ratings based on
exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity. For example, define and quantify sensitivity in terms of
potential impact (e.g., costs, delays, disruptions).
 Qualitative risk ratings –Identify “risks” rather than “vulnerabilities.” The concepts are similar, but risk
is different in that it incorporates likelihood of potential impact.
• Risk is traditionally defined as the product of likelihood and consequence. Likelihood is parallel to
the exposure component of vulnerability, and consequence is parallel to sensitivity.
• Likelihood of potential impacts can be very difficult to evaluate, given the uncertainties inherent in
climate projections. However, some agencies are more familiar with the concept of “risk” than
vulnerabilities, so choose to present risk ratings.
 Quantitative risk ratings – Use a quantitative approach to calculate risk of impacts.
Determine Approach
Regardless of the intended outputs, there are three primary options for how to determine those outputs.
 Data-driven, desktop analysis – Compile and assess data on climate projections and past impacts of
weather events to determine future impacts of climate change.
 Workshop-based, stakeholder-driven analysis – Engage staff and other stakeholders to qualitatively
assess vulnerabilities or risks. For example, ask staff to identify the locations most susceptible to flooding,
or the hypothetical consequences of different climate scenarios.
 Hybrid approach – Complete a desktop analysis with available data, and “ground truth” the results with
stakeholders through workshops, one-on-one interviews, or other mechanisms to get their feedback.
See the “Getting Started” boxes below for checklists to follow, along with tools and materials to evaluate
climate change vulnerabilities or risks.

Washington State DOT
(WSDOT) Vulnerability
Assessment Workshops
WSDOT identified a strategic goal to
“identify WSDOT facilities
vulnerable to the effects of climate
change and to evaluate and identify
possible strategies to reduce risk.” As
part of an FHWA pilot program,
WSDOT developed a structured,
stakeholder-based approach to
qualitatively assess facility risk. The
project team held 14 workshops in all
regions of the state in which WSDOT
staff rated all State-owned highways
and other transportation assets for
climate vulnerability. In the
workshops, participants used asset
maps, climate scenarios, and their
local knowledge to assess
vulnerability.
At the start of each workshop, the
project team presented a video about
climate impacts on infrastructure,
climate change scenarios for the state,
and impact maps. A GIS specialist
was on hand to overlay detailed asset
inventories with climate impact data.
Workshop participants then used a
qualitative scoring system to assess
roadway segments (or other assets)
for criticality and to rate the effect
that projected changes in climate
would have on WSDOT
infrastructure.
The total number of workshop
participants exceeded 200, including
maintenance staff; regional office
staff; and state ferry, aviation, and
rail system managers.

E. Integrate into Decision Making
1. Identify Performance Measures
Performance measurement can help to measure qualitative and quantitative progress towards meeting the
objectives of TSMO and maintenance programs. Performance measures can also help decision makers in
determining how to spend their limited budgets by focusing expenditures towards specific operational
issues in order to help them improve their performance metric scoring. Many DOTs have adopted or are in
the process of developing performance measures.23 If a DOT desires to become more resilient to the
impacts of climate change, it is important to integrate that desire into performance measures to ensure that
progress toward that goal is tracked over time.
The concept of climate change adaptation and resiliency can either be integrated into existing performance
measures or adopted as a stand-alone measure. Good measures are defined in part by their ability to be
measurable, understandable, and meaningful.24

Integrating Climate Change into Existing Objectives
Florida Department of Transportation's 2060 Florida Transportation Plan outlines six overarching
goals: (1) Economic Competitiveness, (2) Community Livability, (3) Environmental Stewardship, (4)
Safety and Security, (5) Maintenance and Operations, and (6) Mobility and Connectivity. Within each
goal, the plan sets specific objectives. Under the fifth goal, “Maintain and operate Florida’s
transportation system proactively,” one of four objectives is “Reduce the vulnerability and increase the
resilience of critical infrastructure to the impacts of climate trends and events.” The plan outlines
implementation strategies and performance indicators for the goal.

DOTs should consider whether revisions to existing performance measures are necessary to
accommodate climate change. When setting or revising performance measures, it is important to work
with local communities to establish a tolerance level for disruption (i.e., the acceptable level of
operational performance if threat occurs) given the changes that are projected to occur due to climate
change. It will be critical to explain that in some ways TSMO objectives may become easier while in
other ways it may become harder (e.g., increased frequency and intensity of storm events). By using a
scenario planning process, it can be demonstrated that in some instances, it will be harder to maintain
historic levels of service (LOS) with more intense/frequent events and therefore the performance
measures may need to be revised to reflect the changing reality. During this outreach process, it will also
be valuable to discuss the public’s mounting expectations for faster responses and constant access to a
highly operational roadway system in order to emphasize the need to reach a common understanding of
reasonable levels of service during extreme weather events.

23 The FHWA Office of Operations has prepared multiple resources for agencies looking to develop and track performance measurement that
are relevant to TSMO. There resources are available at: http://www.ops.fhwa.dot.gov/perf_measurement/.

2. Identify Potential Adaptation Measures25
Adaptation strategies should be developed to address known vulnerabilities directly—either those already
experienced or those identified through a vulnerability assessment. By mapping the strategies to the
vulnerabilities, there is a direct link from problem to solution. Additionally, the strategies should be
developed to help achieve new or existing performance metrics.
Frequently, adaptation strategies can be identified by looking to best practices in other states or regions
that already experience more severe weather events. While the South may not be used to responding to ice
storms, their counterparts in the North can provide guidance on how to prepare for, respond to, and
recover from this type of event. This “climate shifting” is also true for extreme heat waves, flooding,
landslides, wildfires, and other climate stressors. To develop strategies, review examples and best practices
from other agencies and engage a diverse range of staff within the organization. The staff with longer
tenures frequently knows the issues that arise during extreme weather events and can identify solutions to
the problems.

The Alaska Department of Transportation & Public Facilities (ADOT&PF) is now
conducting anti-icing with salt brine in the City of Fairbanks and other parts of interior
Alaska. Historically, Fairbanks and interior roads would stay frozen from mid-fall to late
spring, but now thawing and freezing rain events have caused the ADOT&PF to perform
anti-icing, something never considered previously in the interior.
Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) recently invested in
improvements to wireless communications capabilities and communication
redundancies between traffic management centers (TMCs). The agency also filled in
communication gaps to ensure continuous communication across rural areas in the event
of an emergency.
Maryland State Highway Administration (MDSHA) has installed backup power supply
to three-quarters of its cameras and will have complete coverage by the middle of 2015.
The situational awareness gained through closed-circuit televisions (CCTVs) is critical
for maintaining public safety during severe weather. MDSHA also has back-up power
on traffic signals to avoid manual traffic direction.
State and local member organizations rely on the Transportation Operations
Coordinating Committee (TRANSCOM) regional coordinating body to lead multiagency coordination and communications, particularly during incidents or weather
events. The organization has developed redundant (duplicate and triplicate) data servers
and networks to ensure its information sharing systems can operate during an extreme
event such as Hurricane Sandy, even in case of power outages. TRANSCOM has two
server rooms and two server feeds within its offices, a backup in New Jersey, and a
disaster recovery site on the west coast.
ADOT&PF issued a policy directive on winter maintenance coordination that requires
all regions in the agency to assist in the event of an emergency, regardless of location.
Likewise, WSDOT effectively dissolves district lines within the organization when
responding to major events so that resources can be applied where they are most needed
across the state.
The maintenance division for Minnesota DOT (MnDOT) recently began working more
closely with the transportation operations centers (TOCs) to ensure that the TOCs are
fully utilizing the MnDOT road weather technology programs to help meet the
organization’s common goal of serving the needs of the freight, transit, and traveling
public communities.

Best Practices from the Field (Continued)
Wyoming
and Utah

Multiple
States

Both the Wyoming DOT and the Utah DOT have citizen reporting programs that allow
travelers to report back to the DOT on road conditions. This expands the DOT’s
awareness of hazardous road conditions on the network and helps the DOT provide
“fresher” traveler information to the public.
The Utah DOT uses the nation’s first road weather reporting smartphone application.
The FHWA Integrated Mobile Observations demonstration project involving multiple
States, including MnDOT and Michigan DOT (MDOT), is a technological advancement
that aims at improving resilience to extreme events. By using mobile data of
atmospheric conditions around the vehicles, operations and maintenance supervisors can
use real-time information to inform decisions about workforce deployment, road
closures, or appropriate treatments to use. The data will eventually be pushed to
connected vehicles for in-vehicle alerts.
Responding to more intense and frequent weather events requires additional staff.
WSDOT has recently begun using the National Guard when necessary for
transportation-related activities. They act as an extension of WSDOT and the
Washington State Patrol in assisting with road closures. WSDOT has found it important
to know which external resources are available (e.g., National Guard), what roles those
resources can serve, and how to access those resources quickly.

It is important to consider a diverse range of adaptation strategies to ensure that possible solutions, easy
and difficult, are considered. Strategies for TSMO and maintenance should include the following types:
 Policy-based changes – including guidance on incorporating climate change adaptation in TSMO and
maintenance programs.
 Built infrastructure measures – including construction of protective barriers, infrastructure hardening,
permanent or temporary infrastructure relocation, development of climate-resilient design standards and
retrofits, and green infrastructure.
 Operational approaches – promote avoidance or reduction of impacts, as well as rapid and effective
response to impacts as they occur.
 Adaptive management – tracks hazards, impacts, costs, and effectiveness of adaptations and postdisaster response to inform the aforementioned categories of adaptation. This type of disciplined tracking
of climate or weather impacts serves as an interim adaptation strategy to help both determine whether
and what adaptation actions are necessary as well as develop a quantitative basis for investments and/or
reimbursements. RWIS can be an important tool in tracking road weather conditions over time,
anticipating maintenance needs, and identifying areas in need of investment.
Table 6 provides examples of some phased adaptation strategies that agencies may wish to consider. Before
selecting any strategies, agencies should understand their own vulnerabilities and undertake a more robust
and location-specific adaptation strategy development process.

Response

Increased frequency of
extreme events may require
additional personnel to
monitor, control, report, and
respond to events. Changes in
long-term climate trends may
also change seasonal work
requirements (e.g., changes in
winter weather seasons,
construction timing, or
landscaping timing) and
necessitate additional or
unique staff expertise to
monitor and respond to new
types of climate events (e.g.,
snow storm in Atlanta).

Short-term: Train existing personnel on
the potential impacts of climate change and
how this may affect their roles and
responsibilities.

Extreme events and long-term
changes in climate can affect
resource requirements. For
example, increases in
temperature can increase
annual pavement maintenance
costs, or changes in freeze/
thaw cycles can increase
potholes. Changes in winter
weather and increasing weather
uncertainty could also affect
budgets.

Siting equipment in areas that
will be impacted by sea level
rise, ecological damage,
flooding, snowfall, or other
climatic events may damage
the infrastructure.

TSMO, Maintenance,
Emergency
Management

Medium-term: Increase the availability of
contract staff to assist during extreme
events. Develop memorandums of
understanding (MOUs) with other agencies
for equipment and staff sharing during
extreme weather events.
Long-term: Hire additional staff to keep
pace with increasing transportation
systems management and operations
(TSMO), maintenance, and emergency
management needs.
Short-term: Increase cost tracking to
respond to specific extreme weather events
(see Getting Started: Data Collection Best
Practices). Establish a “rainy-day” fund for
unexpectedly bad years.

Maintenance

Medium-term: Revise budgeting process
and protocols to account for recent trends
that may diverge from the historical
baseline.
Long-term: Work with meteorologists and
climatologists to develop a process for
taking anticipated future events into
account while budgeting and planning.
Short-term: Consider Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA) flood zone
maps (after confirming the relevant local
maps are up to date) or other similarly
informative maps when siting and
designing sites for equipment.
Medium-term: Include consideration of
future stressors (e.g., accelerated sea level
rise) when making decisions about siting
equipment. Consider changes (e.g.,
increasing freeboard requirements) to
accommodate more intense rainfall events.
Long-term: Shift investments to mobile
data sources (e.g., citizen reporters, snow
patrol reporting, mobile probes), which are
less likely to end up in harm’s way.

may require an increased rate of inspection.
Long-term: Use detailed, downscaled

greater shifts in climate. Dedicate increased
inspection resources to those areas.

3. Evaluate and Select Adaptation Measures
As with all transportation budgeting processes, it is unlikely that DOTs will be able to fund their entire
“wish-list” of adaptation strategies. In order to narrow the list of strategies to a prioritized list, it is useful
to use a systematic evaluation process.

San Francisco Bay Area Metropolitan Transportation Commission (MTC)
In the development of its Adapting to Rising Tides study, the MTC used a series of steps to evaluate
and narrow the list of potential adaptation strategies. Using a screening exercise followed by a
qualitative assessment, the project team selected five strategies for further development.
The screening exercise included questions on the scale and replicability of the strategy, the barriers to
implementation, the urgency of action, and impacts on society/equity, environment, and economy.
The qualitative assessment used an ordinal ranking system to compare the financial, social,
environmental, and governance-related (e.g., funding, legal barriers) performance of the strategies.
As a last level of review, the project team used its professional experience to select a final set of
balanced strategies.
The final report, with documentation of the adaptation action selection process, can be found here:
http://files.mtc.ca.gov/pdf/MTC_ClmteChng_ExtrmWthr_Adtpn_Report_Final.pdf.
Some agencies may have established evaluation criteria for projects through other processes; if so, a
variation on those criteria may prove to be an effective communication tool. If no such criteria exist, the
following criteria may provide a useful starting point:
 Technical and Political Feasibility – how practical it is for a particular strategy to be implemented,
accounting for engineering, policy, legal, and insurance considerations?
 Cost and Benefits – what are the up-front costs of implementation and the ongoing operations and
maintenance costs? If implemented, what is the value of the damages from climate change that
would be avoided?

36

 Efficacy – if implemented, to what extent would the strategy reduce the risk?
 Flexibility – if implemented, how easy would it be to revise the strategy at a later date? What is the
adaptive management potential of the strategy?
 Sustainability – does the strategy advance the "triple bottom line” of sustainability (e.g., what are the
impacts to the economy, society, and the environment)?26

Co-Benefits of Adapting
Departments of transportation (DOTs) should identify and account for the benefits and co-benefits of
integrating specific adaptation strategies into transportation systems management and operations
(TSMO) programs. Generally, co-benefits are assessed at a qualitative level in order to help identify
“win-win” strategies that increase resiliency to climate change and help to achieve other program
objectives. Often, it is easier to obtain support for funding these types of solutions because they
accomplish multiple goals. For example, several DOTs have justified upsizing culverts by highlighting
the benefits for fish passage in addition to the increased capacity provided for increases in extreme
precipitation events.
Some examples of co-benefits include:
 Greenhouse gas mitigation.
 Decreased operating costs.
 Increased roadway safety.
 Sustainability (i.e., improvements to the economy, environment, or social equity).
 Improvements in other performance measures.
Depending on the needs of the DOT, the evaluation can be qualitative or quantitative in nature. A
qualitative evaluation process is generally sufficient for selecting priorities while a quantified evaluation
may be necessary in order to justify funding. A qualitative evaluation may use a simple three point or five
point scale (e.g., low, medium, high or positive, neutral, negative) or rely on a narrative description of the
pros and cons of the strategies. A quantitative evaluation can be more effective when competing for
funding because it enables an agency to show hard numbers about the benefits of the program.
Additionally, quantitative evaluation metrics (e.g., reduction in traffic delay) can be translated into financial
benefits to be used in an economic assessment of the strategy. In some cases, as with FEMA Hazard
Mitigation Funding, it is required to demonstrate the cost effectiveness of adaptation strategies before they
will be funded. For more information on cost effectiveness tools and resources, see the Additional
Resources section of this document.
While evaluation metrics are a useful tool for informing the decision making process, they should not be
the basis for the entire decision making process. The input of the staff who work on these programs on a
daily basis and of the decision makers who understand the needs of the community are also important
pieces of information to take into account during the strategy selection process. Additionally, it is
recommended that the total number of evaluation measures be kept to a small set of valued measures in
order to allow for the output to be digestible and meaningful.

26 In October of 2012, FHWA launched INVEST 1.0 (Infrastructure Voluntary Evaluation Sustainability Tool), a web-based tool that helps
transportation agencies incorporate sustainability considerations into their transportation programs and projects. The tool contains a
module focused on operations and maintenance that enables agencies to self-assess their operations and maintenance activities with regard
to sustainability. The tool is available online at: https://www.sustainablehighways.org.

Consider Implementation Time Frames in Prioritizing Strategies
Prioritize adaptation measures into short-term (0-5 years), medium-term (5-10 years), and long-term
(10+ years) actions based on both the urgency of adapting (how soon the department of transportation
(DOT) needs to implement the strategy to protect against the projected climate changes) and the time
period of implementation (how long it will take to implement the adaptation strategy based on planning,
funding, and construction/programming time). The matrix of Climate Sensitive Decisions in Appendix
A provides initial insight into the implementation time period by identifying the frequency with which
the decisions are made. See the following table for examples of how the time period for implementation
and the level of urgency could factor into strategy prioritization.

In addition, consider the existing repair and replacement cycle before implementing a stand-alone
project. Proactive measures often make sense for high-value assets or assets that would be
catastrophically damaged during extreme weather events, while continuous repair/maintenance (i.e.,
opportunistic adaptation efforts) is often the best approach for preparing for smaller, more frequent
events and for assets that are less vulnerable to climate change.

4. Determine Improvements in Capabilities Necessary for Successful Implementation
Successful implementation of adaptation measures may require more overarching enhancements to the
agency’s capabilities. As described in Section II.E. FHWA has developed a primer that outlines six
dimensions of capability that are closely associated with more effective TSMO activities (including those
related to reducing climate change impacts).27
Improvements in one or more of these capabilities may be necessary to successfully implement the
adaptation strategies discussed under “Identify Potential Adaptation Strategies.” Table 8 denotes which of
the above capabilities apply to a range of potential adaptation strategies.

F. Monitor and Revisit
Monitoring and evaluating helps keep adaptation efforts on track as new information on climate risks
emerges, evidence of the effectiveness of adaptation strategies becomes available, or other programmatic
changes occur. Monitoring and evaluating serve to assess progress toward goals and objectives. These
functions help an agency identify which activities are working well and which ones need to be refined.
The FHWA Framework describes the following steps as key to efforts to monitor and revisit: 28
 Establish a monitoring and evaluation plan.
 Engage stakeholders.
 Monitor and collect data on relevant indicators.
 Evaluate the project and its outcomes.
 Revisit.
TSMO and maintenance programs are flexible (much more so than infrastructure planning and design
decisions) and can evolve as conditions change.

adaptation/ongoing_and_current_research/gulf_coast_study/phase2_task6/page04.cfm.
41

Monitoring trends in extreme weather events (such as frequency of particular events as well as impacts on
TSMO and maintenance) and evaluating the effectiveness of actions will help to continually inform
decision making. Monitoring trends in extreme weather events, for example, can help decision makers
recognize when they need to manage for “new normal” conditions. As mentioned above, climate change
refers to significant variations in temperature, precipitation, wind patterns, and other measures of climate
lasting for an extended period of time. It may be decades before there is a robust enough set of data to
attribute changes in trends to climate change. Such attribution is not necessary, though, to recognize that
what once was rare is now routine.
Further, collection, storage, and analysis of monitoring weather data and the impacts of extreme
weather events on TSMO, maintenance, and emergency managers (e.g., through post-event
assessments and documentation) may be integrated into existing asset management systems or other
systems to facilitate continuous or on-demand evaluation of the effectiveness of existing practices.
This can also help to assess the need to revisit assumptions, underlying data, approaches, or program
goals and objectives articulated at the outset.

Getting Started: Data Collection Best Practices
The more transportation agencies understand the effects of weather events on their system and how
those events are changing over time, the better they can make decisions about how to plan for or
otherwise manage these events.
Understanding changing weather effects requires collecting data and other metrics. Departments of
transportation (DOTs) routinely collect and analyze large amounts of data on their operations and
systems. As a result, the most effective way to collect additional information that will enable DOTs to
learn about the effects of climate change will be to integrate data collection and analysis into existing
processes. Potential existing processes that could serve as a “home” for weather and climate tracking
include asset management programs, work order or labor tracking systems, weather severity indices,
and performance measures.
Asset Management Programs
State DOTs are in the process of developing risk-based Transportation Asset Management Plans
(TAMPs), in fulfillment of Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (MAP-21) requirements.
TAMPs and associated asset management systems provide an opportunity for DOTs to integrate climate
change risks alongside the other risks to transportation systems. Additional guidance is forthcoming
from the National Cooperative Highway Research Program (NCHRP) on integrating climate change and
extreme weather into TAMPs.29 Below are some steps DOTs can take to capitalize on their asset
management efforts to help inform their decision making around climate change.
 Incorporate fields into asset management system(s) to track the climate change or weather-related
vulnerabilities of each asset, if known through a vulnerability assessment.
 Configure the system to provide alerts when vulnerable assets are due for maintenance, repair, or replacement.
 Incorporate fields to help monitor vulnerabilities and effectiveness of adaptation over time. Example
fields may include:
• Maintenance instances, including specific cause (flooding, extreme heat, extreme cold, etc. – more
than just “weather-related”) and cost.
• Flooding frequency.
• Work order frequency.

Work Orders or Labor Tracking Systems
DOTs typically have systems in place to track employee activities and expenses, at least to an extent.
DOTs can leverage these systems to better track the impacts of weather events over time by creating work
order numbers, charge codes, or similar codes tied specifically to weather events.
 Set up work order codes for:
• Individual weather events (specific storms), or
• Categories of weather events (heat, snow/ice, rain, storm).
 Instruct staff to charge their time and expenses to the appropriate work order code. This will allow tracking
of agency costs including:
• Labor costs – regular and overtime.
• Contractor costs.
• Materials costs.
• Equipment costs.
 Associate societal impacts the agency is already monitoring with specific weather events or event types.
These impacts may include:
• Delays.
• Accidents.
• Fatalities.

Getting Started: Data Collection Best Practices (Continued)
Using Work Order Numbers to Track Weather Event Costs
The Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA) began creating unique work order
numbers for weather events in 2012, beginning with Hurricane Sandy.
SEPTA created a unique work order number in advance of the storm and instructed staff to use that
number for any time or materials spent on storm preparation, response, and recovery.
As a result, SEPTA captured a much fuller picture of the impacts of Sandy on their operations than they
had for previous storms. For example, SEPTA recorded more than $1.3 million in labor costs, nearly ten
times the labor costs recorded during previous tropical storms—storms that were much more destructive
to SEPTA than Sandy.

Assessment Pilot, Federal Transit Administration (FTA Report No. 0071). Available at: http://www.fta.dot.gov/documents/FTA_Report_
No._0071.pdf, accessed May 20, 2015.

Weather Severity Indices
Many DOTs (including Wisconsin, Indiana, Iowa, Idaho, Minnesota, and Ontario) maintain a “Winter
Severity Index” or similar metric that allows them to compare their seasonal expenditures to the relative
severity of winter weather.32 DOTs use these indices to identify efficiencies in winter weather response
over time and inform budget forecasts.
DOTs may consider tracking similar severity indices for other types of weather events that affect their
operations. For example:
 Summer severity index – This may include calculation of degree-days above a certain temperature
threshold, similar to how the energy sector tracks cooling degree-days.
 Flooding severity index.
 Wildfire season severity index.
 Storm season severity index – tracking the frequency and severity of convective thunderstorm or other
storms on a more seasonal basis.
 Drought severity index (these already exist in other sectors – such as the Palmer Drought Severity Index
– and would be available from the United States Drought Monitor or other agencies within the State).

44

Getting Started: Data Collection Best Practices (Continued)
In addition, DOTs may consider identifying specific impacts associated with climate changes and
tracking the frequency of these impacts over time. This could provide a way to simplify the data tracking
process by focusing on one or two key metrics of vulnerabilities over time, such as those in Table 9.
Table 9. Example Metrics to Track Impacts of Climate Stressors over Time.

Performance Measures
Finally, linking agency performance measures that are already tracked and analyzed to weather, where
appropriate, can be a good way to “mainstream” weather impact data collection. See Section III.E.I for
additional information on linking performance measures to climate change.

Potential Pitfalls of Data Collection
Potential (but avoidable) pitfalls to implementing any of these data collection strategies do exist.
Departments of transportation (DOTs) should note these possible drawbacks early and take steps to
avoid them.
 Data Storage - DOTs need the Information technology (IT) infrastructure to house what could become
potentially large datasets over time. Coordinate with the IT department to ensure the data collection
plan is sustainable from their perspective.
 Staff Time - Data cannot inform decision making without first being analyzed. Analysis of these data
sources needs to be expressly integrated into someone’s job in order for that analysis to happen. The
purpose of the approaches outlined above is to identify opportunities to integrate climate and weather
impact tracking data into existing data collection and analysis efforts to minimize the risk that data
go unused.

IV. Getting Started
This guide provides information and resources to help Department of transportation (DOT) transportation
systems management and operations (TSMO) and maintenance staff use TSMO, maintenance, and
emergency management activities to increase the resilience of their agency to extreme weather events and
climate change. The materials presented throughout this guide will help State DOTs and other
transportation agencies to better understand the risks that climate change poses and actions that can help
reduce those risks.
There is already sufficient information to begin a more concerted effort to evaluate programs and begin to
make or plan to make adjustments today. New information will also continue to emerge regarding
anticipated risks and strategies to address those risks. As it does and as the framework and concepts
presented in this guide are put into practice, it will be important to revisit and refine this guidance.
In the meantime, the specific resources and checklists provided throughout Section IV of this guide in the
“Getting Started” text boxes will enable users to use the segments of the guide best suited to their
individual needs, level of familiarity with climate change adaptation, and readiness to get started on
planning and implementing adaptation measures.

that mitigate the risk associated with the decision due to climate change.

Description

1. Planning for
future workforce
needs

Determine the right
level of workforce
requirements and
capabilities

Operating and emergency
management agencies make a
variety of workforce-related
decisions, including the
number of staff required, their
locations, and the abilities
necessary to monitor, control,
report, and maintain the
roadway system.

Increased frequency of extreme events requires
additional personnel to monitor, control, report, and
respond to events. Changes in long-term climate
trends may also change seasonal work requirements
(e.g., changes in winter weather seasons, construction
timing, or landscaping timing) and additional or
unique staff expertise to monitor and respond to new
types of climate events (e.g., snow storm in Atlanta).

Long-term

2. Planning for
operations and
maintenance
investments

Determine criteria
to prioritize
operational resource
investments
(including capital
improvements)

Resource investments
may include new capital
improvements for operations
and maintenance such
as control systems, field
equipment, vehicles,
communications, and power.
They may also include
investments for annual
maintenance.

Capital improvements should be designed to withstand
the climate changes anticipated over their useful
life. For this reason, all climate stressors should be
considered to ensure investments will make it to the
end of their useful life. Whether features of a project
reduce its climate risk or reduce the climate risk of the
community (e.g., reduce flooding) would need to be
factored into decisions around which investments to
make. Additionally, capital investment needs may be
changing and therefore may require new identification
processes (e.g., increased flood monitors).

Long-term

3. Budgeting for
operations,
maintenance, and
emergency
management

Determine the
appropriate funding
needs and levels on
annual and multiyear basis

Operating and emergency
management agencies are
typically funded on an annual
basis. Funding levels are
a driving factor in overall
program capabilities and
functions.

Extreme events and long-term changes in climate can
affect resource requirements. For example, increases
in temperature can increase annual pavement
maintenance costs, or changes in freeze/thaw cycles
can increase potholes. Changes in winter weather
and increasing weather uncertainty could also affect
budgets. The future climate may require different
resource allocations and budget planning formulas
than today's climate.

Annual

4. Establishing
realistic
objectives

Set regional
operational
and emergency
management
objectives for the
program

Effective planning for
operations and emergency
management requires a
clear articulation of regional
operating objectives.
These objectives define
the response strategies and
the performance-based
management required.

Objectives and performance measures relating to
emergency response or return to level of service may
be affected by the frequency and severity of extreme
events. Additional measures on resilience might
be required to monitor and manage performance.
Additionally, changes in weather patterns may make
select past performance measures unrealistic. The
setting of realistic targets will need to be grounded in
an understanding of future weather conditions.

Siting equipment in areas that will be impacted by sea
level rise, ecological damage, flooding, snowfall, or
other climatic events may damage the infrastructure.
Climate change could also affect where agencies
choose to site new equipment. Flood risk over the
lifetime of the asset could be a criteria used to choose
sites for future equipment. Additionally, agencies
cannot afford to monitor all areas and assets that
will be impacted by climate change. Prioritization
methods and flexible mobile data sources (e.g., citizen
reporters, snow patrol reporting, mobile probes) will
need to be developed.

Long-term

Yes

Establishing adequate
communications and power,
especially redundancy in the
system, is critical to prevent
outages of the field and control
systems. The susceptibility of
communications and power
infrastructure to conditions
can limit the capability of
operational response.

Communication and power lines are sensitive to
icing, flooding, and extreme temperatures (e.g.,
rolling blackouts during heat waves). Flooding can
also damage back-up power systems. Storms can
bring down tree lines which damage power and
communication lines. Agencies will need to consider
whether their existing communication and power
requirements are resilient to climate change. Snow can
cover or block communications (e.g., stop lights and
cameras).

Closely related to the type
of equipment is the correct

to ensure the right extent
of coverage on the system.

Monitoring equipment (e.g., cameras, loop detectors)
is sensitive to weather extremes and flooding. They
can over heat, freeze, or be corroded by water
infiltration. Climate change may also require agencies
to monitor additional stressors/conditions in order
to understand how they may affect the agency in the
future. Early monitoring of climate change stressors
could improve agency abilities to make decisions in
the long-term.

Storm Surge

Monitoring field conditions is
vital to effective operations
and emergency management.

equipment and the available
sources of data greatly
determine the capability to
respond. Sensitive to cost,
these decisions provide the

Inspection protocols
are a vital part of asset
management. For operating
agencies, these include the
full range of transportation
assets from structures to
communication networks.
Due to resource constraints,
agencies need to develop a
protocol designed to prioritize
the key assets being managed.

Climate stressors can lead to increased asset
deterioration, requiring more frequent inspections.
However, inspections are very expensive and time
consuming. Knowledge of climatic trends may allow
for focused scoping of the level of precision and

Decisions involving overall
right-of-way maintenance
such as vegetation control,
drainage, and culvert
management are included
in this area. Often deferred
due to resource constraints,
effective decisions in this area
may in fact be more critical
to operational capability than
anticipated.

Vegetation control: Increased rain (in some parts of
the country) paired with increased temperatures can
lead to additional vegetation growth and death. This
dry fuel poses wildfire hazards. Some areas may begin
to experience drought and need to plant more droughttolerant vegetation.
Drainage and culverts: Following wildfires, rainstorms
can increase debris flow and block or flood culverts
and drainage systems. Heavy rainstorms can blow out
undersized drainage. In coastal settings, sea level rise
may surcharge the drainage systems.

procurement

Agencies spent a significant
portion of their budget on
materials. Procurement
decisions ranging from
timing, type of material, and
the length of the contract
duration greatly affect the
overall cost as well as the
actual season.

If supplies are under-purchased during particularly
bad seasons, it may be difficult to obtain the necessary
materials for response. Frequently, after an extreme
weather event (e.g., ice storm or hurricane), supplies
can run short and distribution lines can be disrupted.
Likewise, if response contracts are too short then
agencies may not be prepared to respond to late season
extreme weather events (e.g., flooding, extreme heat,
snow).

can only be accomplished during a narrow range of
weather conditions. Changes in weather will impact

Appendix B. Additional Resources
Many resources are provided throughout this document. This appendix provides a few additional
resources that may be of interest and use to agencies seeking to embark on adaptation planning.

A. Federal Highway Administration Virtual Framework
The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA)
“Virtual Framework for Vulnerability
Assessment” (Virtual Framework) is an
interactive web version of FHWA’s 2012
Climate Change and Extreme Weather
Vulnerability Assessment Framework. The
Virtual Framework provides guidance to State
departments of transportation (DOTs) and
other transportation agencies on how to assess
and address their vulnerabilities to climate
change. The Virtual Framework breaks the
vulnerability assessment process into six
modules: Articulate Objectives, Identify Key
Climate Variables, Characterize and Select
Assets, Assess Vulnerabilities, Integrate
Vulnerabilities into Decision Making, and
Monitor and Revisit.

Figure 13. Screenshot. FHWA Virtual Framework
for Vulnerability Assessment.

Each module contains step-by-step guidance,
video testimonials from professionals sharing
lessons on their experience, case studies related to the framework step, links to resources related to the
step, and tools to help a user complete the step. The Virtual Framework is primarily focused on assessing
and addressing infrastructure-related vulnerabilities, but offers several resources that can prove useful to
adapting TSMO and maintenance practices. This guide identifies specific resources within the Virtual
Framework as they apply to the steps outlined herein. Readers are encouraged to explore the Virtual
Framework for additional resources that may be relevant to their organization. The Virtual Framework is
available at: http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/environment/adaptationframework.

B. Existing Benefit-Cost Assessment Tools
A number of guidance documents and tools for conducting cost benefit assessments are available for the
transportation sector. Some guidance documents, like United States Department of Transportation's
(USDOT’s) Asset Management Primer or Operations Benefit/cost Analysis Desk Reference, are intended
to inform a particular type of decision or decision maker, but do not address adaptation and extreme events
directly. Some, like National Cooperative Highway Research Program (NCHRP) Report 750, Climate
Change, Extreme Weather Events, and the Highway System, provide a high-level discussion of climaterisk-adjusted benefit-cost-methodology, but do not provide a comprehensive set of resources or guidance
for each step of the analysis. The various tools that exist—such as BCA.net or the Hazard Mitigation Cost
Effectiveness (HMCE) tool—also vary in their audiences, in the types of inputs and outputs they produce,
in the scalability of the projects they can evaluate, and in their ability to capture extreme events or climate
change. A sampling of existing tools and resources is shown in the box below.

Appendix C. Future Research Needs
This guide begins to lay out how climate change will impact transportation systems management and
operations (TSMO) and maintenance and provides actionable steps that practitioners can take to prepare
their programs; however, there are still many topics that require additional research and development. In
order to identify the remaining gaps in knowledge, the following table presents existing needs in TSMO
and maintenance capabilities to address climate change, the actions that need to be undertaken to move
toward a climate resilient program, and the research that remains to be completed to allow departments of
transportation (DOTs) to take informed actions to close the gaps.

Have sufficient resources to prepare
in advance for the coming season
in terms of labor, equipment, and

response materials and supplies
in advance of extreme events.
Redistribute materials prior to an
extreme weather event to ensure
efficient access to needed supplies.
Consider the life-cycle cost
effectiveness of resiliency investments
in budgeting and design. Use asset
management systems to track relevant
information to inform decisionmaking over time.

DOT personnel are constrained in their ability to
justify increases in current budgets, despite potential
savings over time. They have limited information and
tools to determine the long-term cost effectiveness
of actively investing in resiliency during routine
maintenance versus responding after issues arise.

Consider potential future climatic
conditions (and associated
uncertainty) when setting TSMO and
maintenance budgets and workforce
planning.

DOTs rely on historic weather data in their decision
making. They do not have sufficient long-range (1-3
months or 1-3 years) meteorological forecasts to use in
their budget setting process. They face both a lack of
data in addition to a lack of understanding of how to
use uncertain climate projections in decision making.

DOT weather maintenance budgets are frequently
insufficient to allow for the advanced preparation for
extreme events such as investing in equipment, investing
in labor, and stockpiling materials and supplies (e.g.,
culverts) prior to a damaging event; however, after
extreme events, supply chains are frequently disrupted,
materials may be in short supply, and the rushed nature
of ordering after an emergency can increase costs. This
results in delays in repairing and reopening roadways.

Track the reason for damage and the
cost of repair, and incorporate that
information (e.g., Winter Severity
Indices) into budgeting processes.

Actions Toward a Climate-Resilient
Program

Departments of transportation (DOTs) often do not
track the costs of maintenance or damage related to
weather events, which limits their ability to understand
changing costs over time (e.g., related to repeated
repairs due to recurring impacts).

Link climate change considerations
to asset management systems and
use a strategic approach to prioritize
investments between improving
operations on the average day
and improving operations during
extreme weather events. Additionally,
prioritize investments and changes
in practices that benefit both the near

Use a combination of on-the-ground
staff (and potentially citizens),
sensors, and mobile technology to
gain comprehensive coverage of realtime weather and roadway conditions.
Take full advantage of TSMO
technologies both during daily

during extreme weather events.
Use MDSS or other existing tools to
run a series of hypothetical future
storm events in order to inform
operational planning exercises. Use
detailed road weather projections
to project further out in order to
inform an event-specific staging and
response.
Develop MDSS systems that cover

Many DOTs have significant gaps in coverage of
weather and road weather conditions. This makes it
difficult to make informed decisions during extreme
weather events.

Many DOTs optimize their signal timing and other
TSMO tools for managing recurrent delay rather
than managing extreme weather events. While this
approach is effective for increasing reliability, it
might not be the best approach for using these tools to
increase resiliency to weather events.

DOTs need a projection period of more than a
few days to fully prepare a response to a weather
event. Existing tools (e.g., theMaintenance Decision
Support System [MDSS] program) are available
only for winter weather and currently only project
weather conditions 2 to 3 days out (and have limited
geographic scope).

Practitioners other than winter maintenance managers
do not have decision support systems in place to
manage the system based on near-term or longer-term
weather.

Actions Toward a Climate-Resilient
Program

DOT TSMO programs traditionally focus on
improving daily operations (e.g., managing recurrent
delay) rather than proactively developing systems and
protocols for managing extreme weather events. They
are unaware of how adapting TSMO and maintenance
to climate change differs from (and is linked to)
routine preparation for extreme weather events.

TSMO, maintenance, and emergency management
staff is unaware of how climate change may impact
their operations, both in the near term and the future.
There is also inconsistent agreement among State
DOTs that climate change is a real threat that needs to
be integrated into decision making.

DOTs have difficulty managing expectations from the
public for ever-clear roads, which is in direct conflict
with decreasing State funding and more frequent
extreme weather events.

DOTs are historically risk averse and do not want to
change practices until they are required to (as a result
of breakdowns in the existing system).

DOT staff currently report that they are overburdened
by current job responsibilities and have limited
to no capacity or training to take on additional
responsibilities, such as climate change risk and
vulnerability assessments and developing adaptation
responses.

DOT staff does not necessarily have the skill sets
necessary to incorporate climate change into day-today operations.

In addition to not tracking the quantitative costs of
responding to extreme weather events, most DOTs
also do not record qualitative information that
comes from years of professional staff experience.
This makes it hard to retain historic, qualitative
information when staff retire or move on.

environment in a way that effectively uses beneficial opportunities or reduces negative effects. (FHWA
Order 5520)
Adaptive Capacity. The ability of a system to adjust to climate change (including climate variability
and extremes) to moderate potential damages, to take advantage of opportunities, or to cope with the
consequences. (FHWA Gulf Coast Study, Phase 1)
Capability Maturity Framework (CMF). The CMF is based on self-evaluation regarding the key
process and institutional capabilities required from a transportation agency (or group of agencies) to
achieve effective TSMO. This framework is adapted from a concept developed in the information
technology industry called the Capability Maturity Model (CMM), which has been tailored to the
transportation community. The CMF identifies the six key dimensions of process and institutional
capability that directly relate to improving program effectiveness: business processes; systems and
technology; performance measurement; culture; organization and workforce; collaboration. (FHWA,
Creating an Effective Program to Advance TSMO Primer)
Change Averse. A strong opposition to changing practices or beliefs.
Climate Change. Climate change refers to any significant change in the measures of climate lasting for an
extended period of time. Climate change includes major variations in temperature, precipitation, or wind
patterns, among other environmental conditions, that occur over several decades or longer. Changes in
climate may manifest as a rise in sea level, as well as increase the frequency and magnitude of extreme
weather events now and in the future. (FHWA Order 5520)
Climate Stressor. Acute and long-term weather events and trends that have an effect on an asset or
service. Among others, stressors include extreme temperature events and precipitation events, drought,
sea level rise, storm surge, intense storms (e.g., hurricanes and tropical storms), strong winds, blizzards,
humidity, permafrost thaw, and long-term temperature and precipitation trends. (FHWA Gulf Coast,
Phase 1)
Efficacy. The extent to which the strategy, if successfully implemented, reduces the risk. (NYSERDA
Responding to Climate Change in New York State [ClimAID])
Emergency Management. The process of preventing, preparing for, responding to, and recovering from
an emergency; where an emergency is an unexpected, large-scale, damaging event. (TRB Regional TSMO
Committee’s Glossary)
Exposure. The nature and degree to which a system or asset is exposed to significant climate variations.
(FHWA, Gulf Coast Study, Phase 2)
Extreme Weather Events. Extreme weather events can include significant anomalies in temperature,
precipitation and winds and can manifest as heavy precipitation and flooding, heatwaves, drought,
wildfires and windstorms (including tornadoes and tropical storms). Consequences of extreme weather
events can include safety concerns, damage, destruction, and economic loss. Climate change can also
cause or influence extreme weather events. (FHWA Order 5520)

69

Extreme Events. For the purposes of this directive, the term “extreme events” refers to risks posed by
climate change and extreme weather events. The definition does not apply to other uses of the term nor
include consideration of risks to the transportation system from other natural hazards, accidents, or other
human induced disruptions. (FHWA Order 5520)
Feasibility. How practical it is for a particular strategy to be implemented by a department, accounting for
engineering, policy, legal, and insurance considerations. (NYSERDA Responding to Climate Change in
New York State [ClimAID])
Flexibility. Ability to make course corrections if a particular strategy is adopted. Such corrections are an
essential part of adaptive management. (NYSERDA Responding to Climate Change in New York State
[ClimAID])
Performance Measurement. A process of assessing progress toward achieving predetermined goals.
(TRB Regional TSMO Committee’s Glossary)
Performance Measures. Indicators that provide the basis for evaluating the transportation system
operating conditions and identifying the location and severity of congestion and other problems. (TRB
Regional TSMO Committee’s Glossary)
Preparedness. Actions taken to plan, organize, equip, train, and exercise to build, apply, and sustain the
capabilities necessary to prevent, protect against, ameliorate the effects of, respond to, and recover from
climate change related damages to life, health, property, livelihoods, ecosystems, and national security.
(FHWA Order 5520)
Projection. A climate projection is the simulated response of the climate system to a scenario of future
emission or concentration of greenhouse gases (GHGs) and aerosols, generally derived using climate
models. (IPCC Glossary)
Resilience. Resilience or resiliency is the ability to anticipate, prepare for, and adapt to changing
conditions and withstand, respond to, and recover rapidly from disruptions. (FHWA Order 5520)
Risk Aversion. The behavior of humans while exposed to uncertainty to attempt to reduce that uncertainty.
(Wikipedia)
Road Weather Management. Mitigation strategies employed in response to various weather threats
including fog, high winds, snow, rain, ice, flooding, tornadoes, hurricanes, and avalanches. (TRB Regional
TSMO Committee’s Glossary)
Scenario. A plausible description of how the future may develop based on a coherent and internally
consistent set of assumptions about key driving forces (e.g., rate of technological change, prices) and
relationships. Note that scenarios are neither predictions nor forecasts, but are useful to provide a view of
the implications of developments and actions. (IPCC Glossary)
Scenario Planning. Scenario planning provides a framework for developing a shared vision for the future
by analyzing various forces (e.g., climate change, land use, economy) that affect growth and management
of the transportation system. Scenario planning tests various future alternatives in order to identify
solutions that meet state and community needs under a variety of potential futures. Scenario planning is
used in exercises to make critical decisions in the face of uncertainty. (FHWA Scenario Planning and
Visualization in Transportation)

change. (FHWA Gulf Cost Study, Phase 2)
Transportation Asset Management (TAM). A strategic and systematic process of operating, maintaining,
upgrading, and expanding physical assets effectively through their life cycle. It focuses on business and
engineering practices for resource allocation and utilization, with the objective of better decision making
based upon quality information and well defined objectives. (TRB Regional TSMO Committee’s Glossary)
Transportation Management Center (TMC). The hub of a transportation management and control
system. The TMC brings together human and technological components from various agencies to perform
a variety of functions. (TRB Regional TSMO Committee’s Glossary)

performance of existing infrastructure through the implementation of systems, services, and projects
designed to preserve capacity and improve security, safety, and reliability of the transportation system.
(TRB Regional TSMO Committee’s Glossary)
Vulnerability. The degree to which a transportation system or asset is susceptible to, and unable to cope
with, adverse effects of climate change, variability, and extremes. Vulnerability is a function of exposure,
sensitivity, and adaptive capacity. (FHWA Gulf Coast Study, Phase 2)

Appendix E. Sample Handout for Workshop
on Climate Change Risk
This sample worksheet provides the basic format and
illustrative examples for a workshop to explore
climate change risk. The goal of conducting such a
workshop is to develop a more complete
understanding of the direct and indirect impacts and
costs associated with extreme weather events. Then,
this information can be folded back into practices
used by the offices and departments represented at
the exercise (using the approaches suggested in the
guide above).

Scenarios
SCENARIO 1:

Source: Southeastern Pennsylvania
Transportation Authority

Figure 14. Photo. Flooding at Spring Mill Station
on Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation
Authority's Manayunk/Norristown Regional
Rail Line in Philadelphia.

[Description of local past extreme weather event. For
example: Between August 26 and September 3, 2011,
Greater Philadelphia was hit with two tropical storm-force weather events – Hurricane Irene and Tropical
Storm Lee. These storms brought with them torrential rainfall and strong winds across the Philadelphia
region. The storms followed the wettest month (August 2011) in the region’s history. The saturated ground
exacerbated impacts.]
SCENARIO 2:
[To develop a scenario that addresses climate change risk, begin with a severe weather event familiar to
the participants.]
SCENARIO 3:
[To develop a scenario that addresses climate change risk, begin with a severe weather event familiar to
the participants.]

Exercise
The purpose of this exercise is to develop a more complete understanding of the direct and indirect impacts
and costs associated with extreme weather events by retracing the department of transportation (DOTs)
response before, during, and after these events, from advance warning from the National Weather Service
to resumption of normal service and everything in between. We are interested in the responses of all
affected departments.

Sample Discussion Questions:
 How prepared are we for heavy rain events today?
• When we receive advance warning of a heavy rain event:
∘∘ At what stage (x inches of rain predicted, etc.) does your department consider escalating its
responsive actions?

or continuity of those operations for which you are responsible)?
∘∘ What contractors and staff are put on notice in heavy rain event preparations?
∘∘ What materials and equipment are put on standby?
∘∘ How are standby locations determined/prioritized?
∘∘ Under what conditions are you concerned that you may not be adequately prepared for the
event? What elements of your department are not prepared?
• When the heavy rain event is occurring:
∘∘ What actions are your personnel directed to take?
∘∘ What personnel are engaged in the response?
∘∘ At what points are contractors engaged?
∘∘ What triggers use of materials and equipment or alternate locations?
∘∘ What triggers decisions to discontinue service (for a particular operation or for the agency)?
• When the heavy rain event is over:
∘∘ What inspections/audits are conducted to evaluate impacts?
∘∘ How are corrective actions planned?
∘∘ How are operations resumed?
∘∘ To what extent does “mitigation” of future impacts factor into corrective actions?
∘∘ Do you have examples of actions that have been taken in the past after an event?
∘∘ What “lessons learned” have emerged from past events that have not been integrated into the
standard response plan?
• What other indirect costs are associated with the DOTs response to a heavy rain event?
 What data do you collect and retain about past incidents? Based on our current responses, if heavy rain
events were to occur more frequently in the future:
•

Appendix F. Adaptation Checklist for
Technical Staff
Additional Resources
For further information on how to run an exercise of this sort, (particularly how to manage a tabletop
exercise), see: http://ops.fhwa.dot.gov/publications/tabletopexercpe/tabletopexererc_ pse.pdf.
The adaptation framework presented earlier in the guide provides an overview of how transportation
systems management and operations (TSMO) and maintenance groups can begin to take action through
steps to: define the scope of adaptation efforts; assess vulnerabilities to inform the development of
adaptation strategies; and integrate climate change into decision making. The checklist that follows provides
further detail on specific actions that can help move technical staff through these steps.
Define Scope
□ Define TSMO and maintenance program goals and operations objectives that could be sensitive to
climate change.
□ Identify the extreme weather events or trends that could affect the agency’s TSMO and maintenance
programs.
Assess Vulnerability
□ Catalog current capabilities (both technical and institutional).
□ Review traffic incident reports, maintenance records, after-action reports, emergency reimbursement
forms, and other sources to determine how extreme weather events have affected performance in the past.
□ Interview staff across departments about extreme weather-related vulnerabilities
(e.g., “what keeps you up at night?”).
□ Identify points and thresholds where extreme weather affects TSMO and maintenance decisions (e.g.,
establishing future workforce needs, weather response budgeting, setting operational objectives).
□ Document how TSMO and maintenance practices relate to different weather thresholds (e.g., place
sandbags when forecast calls for X amount of rain).
□ Gather information on historic trends in relevant weather variables and/or how those variables may
change in the future.
□ Characterize extreme weather risks via data-driven or workshop-based qualitative or quantitative analysis.
Integrate into Decision Making
□ Identify performance measures and targets (i.e., the acceptable level of operational performance if
threat occurs).
□ Select potential adaptation strategies (selected examples provided below – see more in Tables 6 and 8
in the guide).
Policy-based strategy examples
□ Review and update performance measures in light of extreme weather vulnerabilities.
□ Establish work order codes for weather events or use other methods to improve tracking of labor,
equipment, and materials costs over time.
□ Develop a strategy for incorporating weather trends in budget-setting processes.
□ Require after-action reports with clear recommendations for improvement following extreme events.
□ Update emergency response plans to factor in potential for greater frequency of extreme weather events.
□ Improve cross-training across staff (including across operations, maintenance, and emergency
management).
75

□ Establish regular coordination between on-the-ground staff and other departments to discuss
vulnerabilities and inform investment decisions based on past performance.
□ Establish transition plans for retiring staff to maintain institutional knowledge.
□ Modify current design and procurement criteria to favor durable materials and designs.
Operational and maintenance strategy examples
□ Establish stand-by contracts for extreme event response.
□ Improve intra-agency coordination and information sharing about conditions, closures, resources, etc.
□ Enhance inter-agency coordination to promote establishment of resource-sharing agreements and
information sharing about plans, initiatives, risks, and resources (e.g., include key stakeholders in
routine communications to streamline process during emergency events).
□ Invest in redundant communications systems and data servers.
□ Expand both coverage and quality of fixed and mobile monitoring capabilities.
□ Modify procurement specifications to ensure performance over a wider range of conditions.
Maintenance strategy examples
□ Purchase equipment, factoring in likely future needs based on extreme weather events or climate
changes (e.g., versatile equipment in Alabama to double as snow plows, mobile stockpiles of traffic
control devices).
□ Stockpile materials (e.g., culvert pipe, temporary bridge components, fuel) and equipment (e.g.,
generators, chain saws, traffic control devices) and stage them in strategic areas prior to events.
□ Increase or change vegetation control practices to keep pace with climate changes (e.g., increase
trimming frequency or plant more drought- or heat-tolerant species).
□ Review and consider mitigating vulnerabilities when conducting scheduled maintenance activities.
Emergency management strategy examples.
□ Incorporate changes in extreme event frequency into emergency management planning, including
anticipated staffing, training, and equipment needs.
□ Establish stand-by contracts for extreme event response.
□ Conduct tabletop exercises and use routine events to drill emergency management protocols.
Adaptive management strategy examples
□ Develop a system to track weather-related trends and costs over time (e.g., number of potholes repaired,
snow removal costs, number of emergency event triggers, labor hours devoted to weather preparation,
response, and recovery), such as through designated “weather-related” charge codes.
□ Use asset management systems to track relevant information to inform decision making over time.
□ Configure asset management or maintenance systems to issue alerts when vulnerable assets are due for
maintenance, repair, or replacement.
□ Develop and track performance metrics related to extreme weather (e.g., number/duration of weatherrelated road closures).
□ Evaluate and select adaptation strategies based on factors such as technical and political feasibility, costs
and benefits, efficacy, flexibility, and sustainability.
□ Determine improvements in agency capabilities necessary for successful implementation of adaptation
strategies (e.g., improvements in business processes, systems and technologies, performance
management, culture, organization and workforce, and collaboration).
Monitor Progress and Revisit
□ Establish a plan for monitoring and evaluating progress toward extreme weather resilience.
□ Engage stakeholders needed to support monitoring and evaluation efforts.
□ Monitor trends in extreme weather events and their impacts (e.g., frequency of particular events,
weather-related costs and disruptions).
□ Analyze data on weather trends and impacts to inform decision-making about future strategies.
□ Continually revisit TSMO, maintenance, and emergency programs in light of extreme weather and
climate trends.
