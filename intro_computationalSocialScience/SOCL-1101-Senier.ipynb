    "For this short lecture, we will be discussing some methodologies in Computational Social Science and the influence of Data Analytics in Sociology and other Social Science disciplines. Computational Social Science uses computational approaches to approach social science questions; for data analytics, data is collected, stored, analyzed, and visualized to better understand patterns in human behavior and action. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning Outcomes:\n",
    "- Introduce data collection and analytics \n",
    "- Familiarize yourself with what Python can do\n",
    "- Explore how data is collected through applications like Facebook and Google and how these could be applied to the social sciences\n",
    "- Provide examples for how data can reinforce or challenge beliefs and narratives\n",
    "- Discuss how this data can represent patterns in human behavior and how this data can reflect problematic power structures and biases\n",
    "- Examine the moral and ethical implications of “big data”"

    "* In recent years, a variety of novel digital data sources, colloquially referred to as “big data,” have taken the popular imagination by storm. \n",
    "* These data sources include, but are not limited to: digitized administrative records; activity on and contents of social media and internet platforms; and readings from sensors that track physical and environmental conditions. \n",
    "* Some have argued that such data sets have the potential to transform our understanding of human behavior and society, constituting a meta-field known as computational social science\n",
    "* Lying at the intersection of computer science, statistics and the social sciences, the emerging field of computational social science uses large-scale demographic, behavioral and network data to investigate human activity and relationships.\n"

He found that racial bias may have, in facted, negatively impacted Obama’s election results in particular areas based on the search results in that area. He looked up racially  charged search terms and triangulated those with the election results based on location. \n",
