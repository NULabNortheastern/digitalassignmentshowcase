# "Introduction to GitHub" Workshop
Led by [Cara Marta Messina](http://caramartamessina.com)
<br/>Sponsored by the NULab at Northeastern University and the Digital Integration Teaching Initiative

This is a repository created for the "Introduction to GitHub" workshop held at Northeastern. There have been two workshops so far: one in [2018](https://github.com/caramessina/introtogithub/tree/master/2018-workshop) and one in [2019](https://github.com/caramessina/introtogithub/tree/master/2019-workshop). The goal of this repository is to allow for workshop attendees to familiarize themselves with GitHub; GitHub desktop; and best practices for collaboration, documentation, and naming conventions. 

For questions about this workshop, please contact Cara Marta Messina at *messina[dot]c[at]husky[dot]neu[dot]edu*
