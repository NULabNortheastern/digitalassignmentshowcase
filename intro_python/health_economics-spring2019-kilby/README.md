## Summary of Module
This module will go over the basics of ethical data collection and analysis as well as guide students through a workshop on the basics of using Python to analyze data. The first part of this module looks at the ways in which companies–tech companies like Google and Facebook and insurance companies–collect, analyze, and use digital data. Next, there is a brief demonstration for how Python has been used to tackle research questions. Finally, the workshop walks students through some basic Python commands to import, analyze, and visualize the results of that analysis from a dataset. 

## Learning Goals
- Understand how companies are collecting, storing, using, and profiting off data.
- Understand ethical choices behind working with data. 
- Understand what Python is, why it is useful, and how to use Python for data analysis.
- Understand how Python interacts with, and represents, data.

## Learning Objectives
- Observe trends in the students' own social media data.
- Run cells in Jupyter Notebook.
- Import a .csv file into Python and read it as a dataframe.
- Use several functions for basic statistical summaries and visualizations.

## Documents for Module

### Python Notebooks
[Instructors' Live Coding Notebook](https://github.com/NULabNortheastern/digitalassignmentshowcase/blob/master/intro_python/health_economics-spring2019-kilby/python_for_statistics.ipynb)
This file is an outline of the tutorial, with blank cells. Intstructor should live-code in front of the student and ask them to copy what they type. There are a few exercises throughout for students to complete on their own.

[Filled out Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/NULabNortheastern/digitalassignmentshowcase/blob/master/intro_python/health_economics-spring2019-kilby/python_for_statistics_notes.ipynb)
The completed tutorial, with all of the code filled in. Use as notes for the workshop, and so students have the completed code to reference throughout the semester.
