## Summary of Module
This module will go over the basics of using R to analyze data, with a focus on summary statistics, subsetting and modifying variables, and visualizing distributions. 

## Learning Goals
* Understand what R is, why it is useful, and the basics of how to use R for data analysis
* Understand how R interacts with and represents data
* Explore how to use R to manipulate, analyze, and visualize data to get the information you desire

## Learning Objectives
* Be able to explain R basics: objects, object types, manipulating objects with operations and functions, and data frames
* Explain how R represents data, and how that allows you to analyze data
* Write enough R code to:
  * Read in a data set
  * Manipulate and subset variables
  * Produce basic summary statistics from a data frame
  * Produce (cross) frequency and proportional tables from categorical variables
  * Produce two distribution visualizations from a data frame: histograms and boxplots
  
## Documents

* Intro\_to_R.pdf: a PDF containing all of the R code covered in the module, with text descriptions, for easier downloading and printing. For use as reference for students as they write their own code.
* Intro\_to_R.html: the same as the PDF file with the same name, for easier viewing in the browswer. For use as reference for students as they write their own code.
* Intro\_to_R.Rmd: the R markdown file that produces the .pdf and .html files above. Can be used to modify those two files.
* Intro\_to_R.ipynb: an empy Jupyter notebook with the R kernal, for the live-coding demo.

## Data

* data/inequality\_data_1976.csv: in the data folder is a csv file (comma separated) containing data for use in the module.
