To add a link in a caption, fill in the link you want to use between the quotation marks, 
and replace the word "text" with the text you want to be linked:
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL">text</a> 


To add an image where you don't have an embed code to paste in, fill in the image's URL 
between the quotation marks (if you are editing in the text box, make sure to switch to HTML first):
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bd/Uniform_Resource_Locator.svg"/>
