September 11th and October 30th, 11:45-1:25

<h2>Summary of Module</h2>

This module has three parts. First, this module demonstrates how to use the Tableau software suite to perform spatial analysis and visualizations. It is a two-day module. The first day will go over a tutorial and introduction to Tableau to teach students how to use the specific mapping and visualization software. The second day is a hands-on workshop where students will bring their own research questions to the data provided by Professor Rabrenovic and practice visualization and answering spatial questions using Tableau. Second, we will go over components of storytelling and how these components may be integrated in maps. Specifically, this in-class workshop will teach students how to use [Knight Lab's StoryMap](https://storymap.knightlab.com/) web-browser application by providing step-by-step instructions, a sample map, and sample data for students to use to practice building their own maps. Finally, we will return to the class in a few months to check-in with your progress on the assignment and using these tools. We will ask the students to bring data they’re working with, and any analyses they’ve done, to class and we will work through any issues students are having with the tools.

<h2>Learning Goals</h2>

Students will learn how to use spatial data in a powerful mapping software to produce professional visualizations. Furthermore, students will learn how to use the software to answer data-based research questions. For StoryMap, students will:
* Understand components for compelling storytelling
* Understanding the particular choices made when building a map
* Understanding how to collect data for mapping
* Understanding KnightLab StoryMap’s interface and where it gathers its information


<h2>Learning Objectives</h2>

* Understand spatial data structure in the context of Tableau.
* Learn Tableau terminology and understand how Tableau displays data.
* Know how to plot points in Tableau based upon x/y coordinates.
* Understand filtering and visualization options for spatial data.
* Know how to visualize data using other Tableau methods like line or bar graphs.
* Articulate particular choices made when telling a story using a map
* Follow a step-by-step guide for creating, saving, and publishing maps using KnightLab StoryMap
* Implement data into KnightLab StoryMap, including location information, images, and text
* Navigate StoryMap’s map markers and location-finding system
