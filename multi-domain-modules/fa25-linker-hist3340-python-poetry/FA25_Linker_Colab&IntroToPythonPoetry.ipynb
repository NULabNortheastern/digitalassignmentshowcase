Adding them all to Python would create mass confusion, since many people could use the same name for functions that do different things. The solution then is that functions are stored in [modules](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html) that can be **imported** for use. A module is a Python file (extension \".py\") that contains the definitions for the functions written in Python. These modules can then be collected into even larger groups called [packages](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python/python-packages/) and [libraries](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python/libraries-in-python/). Depending on how many functions you need for the program you are writing, you may import a single module, a package of modules, or a whole library.\n",
