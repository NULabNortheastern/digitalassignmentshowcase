Your public-facing comments should be written to explain how the code is expected to behave, point out the rationale behind your design decisions, and mark out places where a user might want to modify the code.

        "Google Colab, like most digital tools, undergoes constant development. As a result, the digital accessibility of Google Colab can change over time. Users should be aware of common accessibility issues that may arise when using Google Colab with assistive technology like screen readers. Screen reader users may encounter auto pop-ups, poorly-labeled or non-functioning buttons, face challenges identifying if a cell has been executed, and other accessibility issues when coding in Colab. As independent developers, we can test Colab’s digital accessibility and find innovative workarounds, like [user ViewPointUnseen, who outlines Colab’s main accessibility problems and potential fixes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tsypb1GkcjQ) (as of 2024).\n",

        "\n",
        "You have likely heard about AI being used to generate text or [computer code](https://www.wired.com/story/fast-forward-ai-rewiring-coders-brains-github-copilot/). In general, generative AI works by training on very large datasets and then mimicking the patterns in the training data to produce “new” outputs. When using this technology, it is critical to consider its ethical implications. The current lack of regulation around AI has enabled [environmental harms](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/abfba1#erlabfba1s4), as well as the proliferation of [misinformation and disinformation](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-0760/13/10/510), [identity-based violence](https://news.un.org/en/story/2025/03/1161076), and other harmful content.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Most of the [environmental](https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/05/20/1116327/ai-energy-usage-climate-footprint-big-tech/) harms associated with AI stem from the [energy](https://www.energy.gov/articles/doe-releases-new-report-evaluating-increase-electricity-demand-data-centers) and water intensive process of training models and the development of associated hardware and it is difficult to know the exact energy required for a particular prompt. Google is one of the first companies to [publically report](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/infrastructure/measuring-the-environmental-impact-of-ai-inference) on the energy use of an average text prompt processed by a Gemini app. They report that \"per-prompt energy impact is equivalent to watching TV for less than nine seconds.\" While this may not seem like a lot, with [400 million active users](https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/20/googles-gemini-ai-app-has-400m-monthly-active-users/) each month the environmental costs add up. This should also be considered alongside other popular large models such ChatGPT, which has [700 millon active users](https://openai.com/index/how-people-are-using-chatgpt/) each week.\n",
        "\n",
        "By [using smaller models](https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/05/20/1116327/ai-energy-usage-climate-footprint-big-tech/), where possible, and running fewer prompts you may be able to reduce your contribution to AI's environmental impact. You can also integrate tools such as [CodeCarbon](https://codecarbon.io/#howitwork) into your code to track and minimize the carbon dioxide emitted from computers executing the code. To learn more about energy consumption by AI and machine learning, check out the [ML Energy Initiative](https://ml.energy/), a collboration among computer scientists at multiple universities, and the [AI Energy Score](https://huggingface.co/AIEnergyScore).  \n",

        "Google Colab has built in generative AI features that rely on the Gemini model developed by Google. If you are new to programming, it is probably best to turn off these features, as thier results can be misleading or confusing and deprive you of valuable learning oppurtunities. Once you are more farmiliar with coding, you may wish to prompt Gemini for code to help address a particular problem or use code completion reccomendations to speed up your programming. However, it is very important to understand the generated code. It is also important that you stay involved in the code writing process as repeatedly prompting Gemini can lead to a decline in the quality of the results and additional mistakes.\n",

        "To change AI settings in Google Colab, click the settings icon (a gear) in the upper right of the notebook. Then go to AI Assistance. To change the settings for inline code completions and other generative AI features check the appropriate boxes. If you have AI enabled, it will try to autofill in code as you type. You will also be able to click the purple circle icon at the bottom of the notebook to prompt Gemini."

A module is a Python file (extension \".py\") that contains the definitions for the functions written in Python. These modules can then be collected into even larger groups called [packages](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python/python-packages/) and [libraries](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python/libraries-in-python/).
