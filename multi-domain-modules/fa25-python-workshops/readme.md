# Fall 2025 Python Workshops


In Fall 2025, the Digital Integration Teaching Initiative is hosting a series of Python Workshops. The first is on Python and poetry, the second is on data analysis with Python. 

## Python Poetry Workshop
October 29th, 2025

This workshop explored creative and analytical uses of Python. This session introduced participants to creative approaches for writing computational poetry with Python, blending programming and literary expression in an accessible, hands-on format. It also briefly touched on ethics and best practices in the use of generative AI in programming and poetry. 

The notebook used in this workshop is available on Google Colab and in this repository. 

## Data Analysis with Python Workshop

This workshop will focus on data analysis methods in Python, including using the pandas package to partition data and create new rows and columns, conducting statistical testing.

The notebook used in this workshop will be available shortly after the workshop concludes.
