## Individual Class Info
CRWT 1801 

Professor Stephanie Young

Fall 2025


## Summary of Module
This module introduces students to the fundamentals of coding in Python with a focus on creating computational literature. It covers relevant pre-defined functions; variables; various data types including strings and lists and how to access and manipulate them; conditional statements; and libraries and modules and how to import and use functions from them. It also provides a high-level conceptual introduction to generating poetry using artificial intelligence (AI) models.


## Learning Goals
- Understand what Python is and how to use Python for writing computational literature
- Gain awareness of the basic concepts behind generative AI models

## Learning Objectives
- Understand basic concepts in Python including functions, conditionals, and loops
- Use Python to remix/create prose and poetry
