Your public-facing comments should be written to explain how the code is expected to behave, point out the rationale behind your design decisions, and mark out places where a user might want to modify the code.

A module is a Python file (extension \".py\") that contains the definitions for the functions written in Python. These modules can then be collected into even larger groups called [packages](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python/python-packages/) and [libraries](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python/libraries-in-python/).
