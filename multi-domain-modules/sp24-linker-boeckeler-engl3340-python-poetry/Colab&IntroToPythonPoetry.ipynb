Text Cells—These can contain text, images, video, and the other kinds of explanatory content you might find on a regular website. The cell you're reading right now is a text cell.\n","2.

Commenting is also a responsible practice for any code that you might produce and share in the future. Your public-facing comments should be written to explain how the code is expected to behave, point out the rationale behind your design decisions, and mark out places where a user might want to modify the code.
