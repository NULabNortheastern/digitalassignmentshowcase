## Summary of Module
This module introduces students to the fundamentals of coding in Python with a focus on creating computational poetry. It covers relevant pre-defined functions; variables; various data types including strings, lists, and dictionaries and how to access and manipulate them; conditional statements; and libraries and modules and how to import and use functions from them. It also provides a high-level conceptual introduction to generating poetry using artificial intelligence (AI) models.


## Learning Goals
- Understand what Python is and how to use Python for writing computational poetry
- Gain awareness of the basic concepts behind generative AI models

## Learning Objectives
- Understand basic concepts in Python including functions, variables, data types, conditional statements, and libraries and modules
- Write code to: import a module, initialize variables containing lists and dictionaries of strings, access values in lists and dictionaries, call functions from a module, and print values in lists and dictionaries based on conditional statements
