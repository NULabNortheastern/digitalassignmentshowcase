When anything is wrong, when laws are made by men for the
government of men,, which bring about bad social conditions the
greatest obstacle toward the removal of those laws seem to be that
nearly every one considers the evils springing from those laws as
inevetable, as something we can not help even if we would. That feeling
tends to keep us from making any attempt to remove those laws and put
something better in their place. We do not stop to consider that the laws
under wh which we suffer were originally made by man, who were
human beings like ourselves and as liable to make mistakes as we.
Some of those laws were good at the time they were made, centuries
ago, more or less, and suited the scale of development to which the
people had attained at the time.
And because they suited the scale of development to which humanity
had attained in those times, they do not suit the scale of develope ment
at which we have arrived. When I hear the Republican party say that we
must vote their men into office because George Washington used to
believe so and so about the tariff, it makes me think of a mother who
would try to compel her grown up son of twenty-five to wear the
garments he wore when he was a baby, just because he had worn them
when he was a baby.
When I hear the Democratic say that we musy vote to put their men in
office because--because, Well'! I really don't know what it was the
Democratic party wanted to do! Do any of you know?
Again there are laws which have been originated and put into operation
by sharp unscrupulous men for the enriching of themselves

individually, or for the particular class to which they belong, regardless
of the welfare and interest of the masses of people to which you and I
belong.
These sharp unscrupulous men have been helped in their work by men
who were good men perhaps, but who were not sharp enough to see
the full scope of the laws they were putting in operation, or who followed
the head of one of their party leaders because they were too indolent to
think for themselves.
What has been the trend of the monetary legislation for the past twentyfive years? You can see and think it our for yourselves. Ther is no
question of the fact that the poor have been getting poorer and more
numerous, and the rich have been getting richer and fewer in number
during these years.
There is a cause for it. There is a reason for it. It is not a fact that it has
been inevitable. It is something that can be helped and that must be
helped if you do not want your condition and those of your fellow beings
to grow worse than it is. The money question is a question that goes
down into the very life of the people, therefore we, the Populist party
have taken it for the foremost plank in our platform of principles. We
intend that these monetary laws which have been made by the money
classes shall be changed into laws which shall be for the interest of the
whole people.
Look at this broad and beautiful land we are living in. There are trees
enough on it to build a comfortable home for every human being living
on it. There is coal enough to keep warm and comfortable every man,
woman and child through the cold weather. I saw in the papers last

ing coal to keep themselves and their little ones from freezing to deah
death, and they were prosecuted by the coal compaby. Who gave this
coal company the exclusive right and possesion of this product of the
earth, necessary to the life of human beings.
I am sure God did not say to the half a dozen men, more or less who
own the coal mines, I have created this necessary product of the earth
for your sole use and benefit and you must not let your fellow creatures
have any unless they pay you well for the use of it, even if they freez to
death without it. No, God created the earth and every thing in it for the
use and welfare of all his creatures.
It was man who made the laws which put into the exclusive posssion of
these half a dozen human beings a product of the earth necessary to
the welfare of all human beings. And if these laws were made by man,
they can be unmade by man.
There is gold and silver enough in the earth to provide a circulating
measure of value for all the needs of trade and commerce without going
into debt either national or private.
As for the surface of the earth, is it so poor that it cannot raise enough
for us all to eat? We see the boundless harvest of golden wheat and
corn on every side, thousands upon thousands of acres. Every sort of
fruit and food that grows on the surface of the globe somewhere or other
in the United States. What does not grow in one part of the country
grows in another. Then it is not the fault of God or nature that there are
thousands among us who have not enough to eat, who live in a state of
semi-starvation, physical and intellectual, intellectual because those who
are fortunate enough to have work at all, have to work so long in the day
that they have not time or intellectual development, and who

bodies, when their work is over for the day.
Neither is it the fault of God or of nature that there are thousands of us
who are not able to clothe ourselves decently when the material lying
around on every side.
Think of the thousands in Chicago alone last winter who had no where
to lay their heads and how the public buildings of Chicago had to be
opened for them at night lest they should perish, and how they
scrambled over each other in their eagerness for the morsel of bread
doled out by charity.
Think of the thousands upon thousands of workmen out of work begging
for the work which lies around on every hand waiting to be done
because there is not enough money in circulation to set the work going.
Whose fault is it?
As I have said before, this money question is a question which goes into
the very life of the people. It affects their physical well being, their liberty,
their morality. When a man has to struggle all his life for bare food and
clothes and shelter, he is apt to let is liberty lokk out fo itself, and he has
not much time to think about is mind and soul. And his mind and soul
were given him by the creator to develop and cultivate so that he should
at last become as perfect as God intended him to be.
The condition of things which I have attempted to describe and toward
which we have been tending for the last twenty-five years under the
leadership of the Republican party, is as bad for the rich man as it is for
the poor man. It is as bad for the millionaire as it is for the tramp.

Do you realize that neither of those two words, millionaire and tramp
was in existence thirty years ago? Because the millionaire has so much
and can make so much by taking advantage of the existing laws, he
gets to thinking that the world was made for him to take his pleasure in
regardless of the rights of others, and the worst of it is that the people
gets to thinking so too, when they get to thinking that such a condition of
affairs is inevitable. The rich [[strikethrough]] man [[/strikethrough]]

forgets the fatherhood of God and the brotherhood of man. He becomes
a dead loss to the community, and not only that, he becomes a

He stands in the way of progress; he uses all his money, and all the
power which his money gives him to keep the bad laws, through which
he made his money, in existence, so that there shall be no change
toward better condition for the rest of humanity.
He believes in corporations and monopolies because they want to keep

come uppermost in their scramble for offices.
When we consider how vital the money question is to us all it s seems
strange that we have allowed the financial policy of the nation to pass
into the control practically of one man, John Sherman. He is one of of
the ablest and shrewdest [[insert]] men [[/insert]] in the country. After
having watched on the floor of the Senate almost day after day during
the past year, after having compared the speeches he made at one time
with those he made at another time, the speeches he made before
election with those he made after his election, after comparing the
statements he made at one time on the floor of the Senate with those he
made on the same floor on the same subject and matter at another time;
after looking at the character of all the money bills he introduced and
engineered through Congress, I have come to the conclusion that he is
a man without a conscience in regard to the interests of his fellow
beings, and that he , for his own interest and those of his own class,
deliberately brought about the present condition of things.
One of the most respected men of his own party, Teller of Colorado, got
up on the floor of the Senate last spring and said that for years past
Sherman had been in the habit of stating untruths on the floor of the
Senate. What did Sherman do? That was the question we, who had
heard Teller make the change, asked day after day for a week. Did he
challenge the statement? Not all. He kept silence. There he showed his
ability and shrewdness.
He did not want the matter made public, which it would be if he
answered the charge, besides which [[insert]] the [[/insert]] charge could
be proved.
Sherman is a tall thin man with delicately cut features which sharpen
into eagerness only when the money question is brought on the floor.

He was most on the alert when ^[[the]] two Populist Senators, Allen and
Peffer had the flo r on some money resolution which they wished to
bring forward in the interest of the people.
It was significant of the fact that the Populists are on the right track for
the settlement of the money question. He took the trouble to squelch
their resolutions and made the attempt to answer their arguments when
he did not think it worth his while to pay any attention tot the resolutions
of any other Senators in either of the old parties.
It was a new experience for him to have his financial policy questioned,
his statements contradicted, his word discredited, he whose head had
been blindly followed by the men of his party for years, and whose
manipulation of the national currency had affected the welfare of the
whole nation; and all this brought [[strikethrough]] about [[/strikethrough]]
on him by two comparatively unknown men if a dispised party, just
springing into existence.
I sometimes think that the good men of a party are greater obstructions
in the path of progress than the bad men in it, for there are a few good
men left in them. For instance there is Hoar of Mass.
His round smooth face beams with geniality and twinkles all over with
fun when he gets of some little joke on his colleagues, or criticises the
wording of some resolution. He is full of classical quotations and
learn^[[ed]] historical illusions to the times of the ancients. He is
considered an able lawyer, and yet he got up on the floor of the Senate
this summer and unblushingly stated that he had been in the habit of
following the lead of his friend John Sherman on all financial questions.
What good is all his good nature and culture, to humanity when they do
not even lead him to take enough interest in the welfare of the

of the pe le he represents to take the trouble of studying one of the most
vital questions of the day for himself/.
[[handwritten]] X [[/handwritten]] Instead, he has been following blindly
the lead of a man without a conscience. In, the result, John Sherman's
conscience becomes literally [[?]] his conscience, and yet he would be
shocked if he were told he were a man without a conscience, or any
moral sense. If all the men in a party were bad men, it would be easy to
sweep aside the men who stand in the way of progress and better
conditions for humanity.
As it is, [[strikethrough]] common [[/strikethrough]] the average man
gets to thinking that because there are good men in a party, the party
must be all right. That is bad logic. Harrison was a good man but he was
at the beck and call of the money classes. The good men like Harrison
and Hoar are just as much a detriment to humanity as the bad men,
when they follow the lead of bad men unquestioningly. There is one
thing I have noticed in the Senate and that is that all the unprincipled
men in it all work together and hold together, no matter which of the two
parties they belong to, if [[strikethrough]] to [[/strikethrough]] the interests
and privileges of the moneyed class are endangered.
For instance when the sugar trust lacked a vote on the Democratic side,
the lacking vote was supplied by Quay, of Penn. [[strikethrough]] ?

I think that we, as a people have paid too much attention to the men we
have hired to do the work of the nation,. and not enough to the principles
which we advocate and want to put into practice. Ideas worked into
principles and principles enacted into laws are the only things which
move the world or change the conditions in it. And yet what

down, to carry our ideas into practice. What sort of a man have we as a
people placed at the head of the nation. Let Gorman of Maryland, the
Presidents right hand men and one of the great leaders of his own party
answer.
I heard him last July on the floor of the Senate, with his face as white as
a sheet, in the presence of one of the greatest audiences ever seen in
the Senate Chamber, declare that he himself, Brice of Ohio, Smith of
New York had waded through mud and filth and slime to place Grover
Cleaveland in the Presidential Chair. What a statement to make of the
head of a nation by his own especial followers.
The people ought to have known that a man who could be false to all
the duties and trusts of ordinary private life would be false to all his
national duties and trusts. And as for Gorman and Brice, and Smith, and
Hill. What of them?
Gorman's statement proved that they were fully as bad as Cleaveland
himself, in that they [[underlined]] could [[/underlined]] wade through
mud and filth and slime, to place such a man as that at the head of
affairs to wield the destinies of a nation. What a set of men have we as a
people hired to make our laws and do our work! What an unbusinesslike
proceeding to hire men to do a certain piece of work and then give them
their salary and pay them all honors in addition, whether they have
performed their work or not. If a hired man in private life does not do the
work he is set to do or does it badly, he is discharged. In your national
life if your hired man does not do what he was sent to Congress to do,
he is re-elected and sent back with honors. Take for instance one of
your own Congressmen, [[strikethrough]] Bynum [[/strikethrough]]

expected to vote to send him back to Congress, and to work hard and
with the toil of your hands earn enough money to help pay his salary of
five-thousand a year and no one knows how much more besides. It is a
curious condition of affairs to say the least. You will give through your
vote enough of your hard earned money to pay this man to keep up the
present condition in which you do all the hard work and he takes all the

These men, from the President down are literally your servants, for your
money goes to pay their salaries. You should at least see to it that these
men perform the work you set them to do, and that they work in the
interest of their masters. If they don't, discharge them unpaid, and select
men who will. The time has come when from lack of principle on either
side the two old parties have practically become one. They have nothing
to work for but their own interest and they only cling to the name
Democrat of Republican because it is the only way by which they can
obtain offices.
At my old home, in the little town of Bancroft, Neb., two men who were
cousins were also partners in business. One was a Democrat, the other
a Republican. When Cleaveland was in, the Democrat was the
postmaster, When Harrison was in, the Republican was the postmaster.
The plan worked beautifully so far as keeping the money in the family
was concerned.
The Republican party has been in power so long that they as well as the
Democratic party utterly scorned all the efforts of the people to better
their own condition.

existence.
We have tried the present system of managing these national functions
and we can all see that the present system has worked disastrously.
One of the editions of our paper for whom I have been working a year
past, asked me how I happened to become interested in politics.
I could not answer the question at the moment but you may have
thought of the same question. I will try to answer.
In the first place, I am an Indian and was brought up in the midst of my
people. Neither my father or mother could speak English or read or
write. You might search the world over and you could not find a better
father and mother, intellecually and morally, and I speak this
understandingly for I have had the privilege of knowing intimately some
of the very highest and best among your people in all parts of the world.

No child could have had a happier childhood than I. Family affection
among the Indians is peculiarly strong. My father died about four years
ago; my mother is still living. My father was one of the chiefs of the
Omaha Tribe who sold the land Omaha City stands on, and then the
government placed us on a Reservation, forbade us to leave it without
permission of an agent, and left us there cooped up where we could not
come into contact with any civilization but our own, without any schools,
and expected us to become civilized. The Agent and his employees
interested themselves very little in the Indians, but staid there simply for
the purpose of intercepting the money which the government reached
out to us as pay for the lands we had sold, and we came into very little
personal contact with them. We Indians began to fret because the
government eventually prevented us from leaving the Reservations to
go out on the buffalo hunts.
The buffalo were literally the life of the Indians. They were food and
shelter, and clothing to the Indians. We were shut up there without any
occupation. We had no schools.
By and by the Presbyterian board sent two or three missionaries to our
reserve to open up a little Mission school. My father sent my sisters and
myself to the school that we might learn to speak English, and read anr
write. As I grew up, I began to see how the government treated us
Indians through its agents and employees. If it had not been for the
missionaries we would not have known that there were any good people
among the White people. Some of the worst of the Agents put in jail
some of our very best men because they would not submit to indignities,
or because they had been saucy to an employee. There was no law to

punish a white man who stole from an Indian or who killed an Indian. On
the other hand, if an Indian killed a white man, instead of the Indian
being tried and punished for his crime as a white man would have been,
troops were sent by the government to make war on the whole tribe, and
the whole tribe was punished for what two or three men did. We could
know that the Agent was stealing from us and we had no way of
redressing our wrongs unless we fought, and we knew what the result of
that would be. The white man's story was spread broadcast in all the
newspapers of the land. The Indian had no way of making his side of the
story heard. Sometimes some of the Indians would think that the
President cound not know what his Agents were doing, and they would
get myself and my sisters to write to the President for them, telling him
about these things, but the letters would be sent straight back to the
Agent, and he would make his displeasure felt by those who had sent
and written them. When I grew old enough to think, I saw there was no
help for us Indians unless we were made citizens, and titles to our lands
were given us so that we could not be torn from our homes any more by
the government. If we were citizens we could vote and our lives and
property would be protected by the laws of the land. There were others
who thought so too, and an opportunity occurring, we started an
agitation on the subject throughout the Country. Eventually, and after
having the whole Interior Department to fight against, we succeeded in
having laws passed which changed the old conditions of things, and
gave the Indians the same chance to live that white men had. My tribe
was one of the first to become citizens, and get titles to lands in
severalty. Hitherto the Indians had acted on the principle that God had
given the land to everybody, ad

that the land was as free to every human being as the air and water.
They would as soon have thought of individual ownership to air and
water as individual ownership of land; but when they saw how the white
people put a price on land, they became eager to own land individually.
After we had passed the laws we wanted I went to our reservation to
live. I watched the experiment,for those who fought against the passage
of our bills said an Indian wouldn't work, and that he could neither be
civilized nor educated.
Indians who had never been taught to harness a horse or hold a plow
began to farm and put up little homes, and build stables. They carried
their wheat to the railroad elevators to sell. They farmed more and more
every year. They voted; and voted the old party tickets, as the new party
was not yet organized. So far they exceeded all expectations, but there
it seemed to end. Where was the practical result of their labor? They
barely received enough for their work to keep them decently clothed and
fed. They lived in a state of semi-starvation as before, and yet, they
were working harder than they ever worked before. In a certain sense,
they were worse off than before so far as clothing was concerned , since
the old condition of things they did not care much wheather they wore
any clothing or not, when they did want any they killed deer and buffalo
and prepared their skins for clothing. Civilization brought new wants in
its train. I lived on the boundary line of the reservation. I looked around
on the white farmers and I began to notice how they worked and lived. I
saw whitewomen who arose before sunrise, summer and winter, milk
the cows, get the breakfast, see their children off to school, wash the
dishes, take care of the milk, churn; scrub, make their own, their
husband's and their children's clothes,

keep their houses in order, do the washing and ironing for the whole
family, and I could see that they worked harder than any Indian woman I
had ever known. Sometimes they did not sit down during the day
excepting to eat their meals. Their husbands worked as hard as they,
their lives did not look as if they were worth while to live. They had no
leasure for culture, and no beauty and joy. In one way I found we Indian
were better of than they, because the land on which they lived and were
working so hard, was mortgaged to some man or company, and
everything they could make above their bare food and clothes went to
the bank or company who held the mortgage; while in the law by which
we Indians held our land, was a provision which forbade the mortgaging
of our lands or the payment of taxes for twenty-five years. We Indians
were free from the fret and worry of knowing that a mortgage might be
foreclosed on our lands and homes at any time, and that after a lifetime
of hard work, we might be turned out to starve or die by the roadside.
The home of nearly every farmer in our neighborhood was mortgaged. I
have listened to the farmers as they talked; I heard them say that they
did not get enough for their crops to pay the expenses of planting. All
this set me to thinking as to the cause of such a condition. I had heard
my husband discuss the money question for years without paying any
attention; I now began to listen.
My husband began writing articles of finance for the leading daily paper
of the West: The Omaha World-Herald, and which attracted the attention
of Senators in Congress because they reflected of the new reform party
just springing into existence. He threw himself heart and soul into the
new movement. The editors of the leading reform paper, American
Nonconformist, proposed that we should go to Washington to

correspond for their paper about the doings of Congress.
It seemed to me that one of the greatest needs of the people and new
party was knowledge, and truth as to the doings of Congress and the
kind of laws made there for the people. I saw that the great daily papers
were controlled through the press corporations and by the money
classes and that they covered up the things which it was to the interests
of the people to know. My husband and I accepted the offer and he
commenced our work on the day the silver session opened and he kept
at it the whole year.
So you can see how natural it was that I brought up by a father to whom
the welfare of the community which they were placed was paramount
too all other considerations, come to join the reform movement.
Christ, the greatest man off all the ages was a social reformer. Who
drove the money changes out of the temple? It was Christ . Who taught
the religious classes of that day that the Sabbath was made for man and
not man for the Sabbath? What is the principle that underlies that
statement? It is worth the thinking out for your selves.
Who heard Christ Gladly? "The common people," like you and me .
When Christ dined with the common people, what did the religious and
money classes say? They said he dined with publicans and sinners. He
"had not where to lay his head" was therefore dispised by the religious
and money classes of the day and yet he spent his whole life, not in the
making and getting of money for himself, but in teaching and showing
the common people that the conditions under which they lived were not
inevitable and that they were capable of reaching up to the very highest.
I think that some of us are just beginning to understand the teaching of
His whole life, the fatherhood of God and the brotherhood of man.
That means opportunity, liberty, Fraternity, equality for all and

not only for a small class of men.
It was Christ who added, "Thou shalt love they neighbor as thyself" to
the old Commandment, and He would not have held it as an ideal to live
up to if it had been impossible to practice or enact ^[[it]] into laws for our
dailt living. I think the Populist Party should adopt as its motto, "What is
to the interest of one is to the interest of all and what is to the hurt and
injury of one is to the hurt and injury of all." The Gospel statement "Love
is the fulfilling of the law" is literally a statement of scientific fact; and it
for each one of you to help put into effect as far as possible by your
vote.

^[[I have this in original manuscript VB]]
At the time I was born we were all savages, that is my tribe the Omahas.
I suppose if you were to see us on our reserve now you would think we
were savages yet, for only a few can speak or read or write the English
language and most of us dress in our own costume. I have sometimes
had the question asked me, is your tribe civilized? And I have really not
known what to answer. I have known men and women all my life who
are brave, generous, truthful, honest, industrious, patriotic, and lovely in
all the relations of life and yet if you were to see them you would call
them savages because they can neither speak or read or write the
English languages or dress as you do.
My own father and mother are examples of that I think. My father is
rather stern and strict in his ideas of right and wrong, and people - both
whites and Indians - are apt to be a little afraid of him, not physically but
morally. But my mother's gentleness makes up for that, and even my
father's political enemies come to him for help when they get into
trouble, and strangers from the other tribes come long distances to ask
his advice about their tribal affairs. As for us children, although my father
was strict and stern in our upbringing, yet we never doubted his love for
us.
I can't tell in words what my mother had been to us all. My father can
never bear to have her away from his side even for one day, and we
four sisters as we have grown into womanhood have learned by
experience to realize more and more the beauty and nobility of my
mother's whole life. It seems curious to think of, that here is a family, the
father stern, upright, independent and one who has been in battles with
the enemies of his tribe and who is chief of his tribe, and four daughters
educated in the religion and accomplishments of a foreign people, one
of whom has just

graduated in a school in the east, another who is studying medicine in
Philadelphia and who will be a physician, and another married to an
American and mother of a lovely family of growing children, - all these
clinging to the love of one uneducated woman as their highest earthly
good and the central object of all of them, around which everything
seems to center. I think it is only another instance of the power of
character over mere intellectual attainments. Outside of our own family, I
believe that everyone on our reserve, from the missionaries down,
values my mother's good opinion above that of anyone else. So you see
it puzzles me when people ask me, Is your tribe civilized?
Perhaps you will understand a little more about us if I tell you a little
[[strikethrough]] more about [[/strikethrough]] about ou^[[r]] tribal
government before the United States government interfered with us. A
tribe is divided into bands. Our tribe has nine bands. Each band is
divided into families and the geneologies are kept so exactly that in
some bands there are a great many families and in others only a few
according as they diminished or increased during the years. Each band
has its own chief, then there is a headchief over all. When a council is to
be held the men of a band are summoned together, usually at a feast,
and they consult together as to what the chief is to say in that council. In
other words, he represents the men of his band in council and votes as
they wish. Then all the chiefs in a tribe hold a council by themselves and
decide what they shall do or say when the final council with the United
States government or another tribe is held. It is really a representative
government. I think that this is the reason that an Indian tribe has never
been known to violate a treaty made with the United States government.
From the very form of their government the whol^[[e]] people have
pledged themselves, as it were, to keep the treaty.

The executive power is vested in the Soldiers Lodge, which is a
powerful organization, and the headsoldier of the Soldiers Lodge has
the power of life and death in his hands. The Soldiers Lodge executes
all the orders of the council. The members of the Soldiers Lodge are
elected and they elect the headsoldier, who is usually a man of energy
and character and who often has more influence than a chief. When the
headsoldier leads a war party he is treated with the greatest honor that
can possibly be shown him. The members of the party vie with each
other in waiting on him,-his campfire is made first, his food is cooked
first, and his comfort is to be considered above everything else. On the
other hand the headsoldier must be at the front in battle and he must be
last in a retreat, and he must be ready to sacrifice his life for the safety
of the party any moment that it may required of him.
There are rules governing the conduct of a war party. The principle on
which the American Indian race have acted in their relations with other
peoples has been the same as that of the Old Testament doctrine "an
eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth." A tribe occupies a piece of land
which is the permanent home of the tribe. The tribe lives in villages, in
mud-lodges as they are called, and in tents. Some of the bigger lodges
are capable of holding two or three hundred people at a council or feast.
Besides this permanent home of a tribe, each one claimed a large scope
of country as a hunting ground and it was while encroaching on each
others hunting grounds that battles took place between different tribes,
and war was kept up for generations between certain tribes. The most
sacred things which the Indians possess are Peace Pipes, of which
there are always two. When the Peacemaker of a tribe goes forth in the
midst of a battle with the Peace Pipes held before him the battle
instantly ceases even though it were in the very height of a battle. The
Pipes are four or five feet long and beautifully decorated. They are never
allowed to touch

the ground and are kept wrapped in furs. When the pipe of peace is
smoked with an enemy, even a personal individual enemy, his life is
sacred in your hands.
There were also rules for the conducting of the annual buffalo hunt. The
Indians made most of their living from the buffalo. Every summer after
the crop was put in the whole tribe started for the buffalo hunt to be
gone for about three months. The tribe camped at night in one great
circle in the order of bands and families. Each band had its place in the
great circle, each family its place in the band and each member of a
family his or her place in the tent. Father and mother usually occupied
the right hand side of the tent. The middle place of the tent at the back
(for the fire was in the center) was usually cleared for honored guests. In
the summer the fire was built out of doors and the sides of the tent
would be turned up halfway to let the wind blow through, and the fresh
green grass with buffalo robes or straw mats thrown over it made as soft
a lounging place as one could wish. The life we lived while on these
hunts seems like one long joy to look back on and we children were
happy all day long. There was such a sense of utter freedom. But to get
back to my subject.
When we got to the country where the buffalos were, all the men of the
tribe got together to give chase while the women hurried on to the next
camping place to put up the tents and get ready for the return of the
men with the meat. There were two men of our tribe who violated the
hunting laws. They were flogged so severely that one of them died from
the effects of it, and the other lost his mind and became paralyzed for
life. They had discovered a herd of buffalo and instead of going back to
tell the proper authorities so that all the men of the tribe might join in the
chase they scared the whole herd away just to get a few. A tribe might
be starving and their lives might depend on getting a herd.

We used to have such happy times in the evening waiting for the return
of the hunters. We children used to run to meet our fathers and brothers
when we saw them coming over the prairies that we might have the fun
of leading in the horses loaded with meat. A man would kill a buffalo
with his bow and arrows leaving the buffalo where it fell would run along
by the herd to kill others. Then after the chase was over he would ride
back over the ground to look for the buffalo he had killed. Each man
knew his own by his arrows. The women took the meat when it was
brought home and, excepting what was reserved for immediate use,
they sliced it in broad thin slices and hung it up in the air to dry for winter
use. The atmosphere on the prairies is so dry and bracing and there is
such a constant breeze that it took a very short time for the meat to dry.
It was taken in at night if there was a dew. The prairies are more like the
ocean than anything I know of and you might travel for days without
seeing a house or a human being.
The buffalo skins were tanned in a good many different ways for
different uses. They were tanned in such a way with the hair left on that
they could be used as rugs or robes or wraps and could also be used as
moccasins in the winter with their hair inside. Another way was to take
the hair off and tan them till they were as soft and pliable as cloth and
then they were used for clothing and the finer sorts of moccasins and
also for tent cloth. Still another way was to tan them leaving the skin so
hard that they could be used for packing cases. These packing cases
were usually painted on the outside. I remember once when we came to
a stream which was too deep to be waded and there was no time to
build canoes, and they took these packing cases and put two or three of
us children in each and towed us across. It used to be a fine sight to see
hundreds of horses swimming in a river. The [[strikethrough]] simew
[[/strikethrough]]] ^[[sinew]] was used as thread and the bones for the
handles of tools and implements.

Hunting was a business with the Indians. Besides the buffalo they
hunted deer, elk, antelope and wild turkeys. Hunting was not with them
as with you mere sport but hard work, for when they did not meet with a
herd of buffalo a man might be all day hunting and return home at night
with nothing. I believe the white people think that the Indian men look
down on their wives and make them do all the hard work. It is not true.
The man had to provide all the meat for the family including of course
the clothing, take care of the horses and be on the alert for the enemy.
The woman put up the tent took care of the children and got the wood
and water. The tribe always camped near a stream. The young girls
usually carried the water and they looked on it as fun. The women also
did the tanning of the hides in the long days when the men were out
hunting. At home the women put in the usually small crop of Indian corn,
beans, and pumpkins, and the produce of the fields was considered
theirs. They dried the corn and pumpkins for winter use. A man would
not think of giving away any of the field produce without asking his wife.
Neither would she give away any of the meat without asking him. Of
course the nearer a man and his wife are the less need is there for them
to ask each other for anything. When a woman marries, her property (an
Indian's wealth is usually reckoned by the number of horses he has) is
her own and her husband cannot dispose of it without her consent. If
there is any trouble and they separate, she takes her own property with
her. Of course there are men among us who tyrannize over their wives
just as there are among you, for I have read about it in your books, and
we have also among us what you call henpecked husbands.
When our tribe submitted to the government we were placed on a
reserve which we could not leave without the permission of the
government. Then you see the man's occupation was gone, but the
woman's work still went

on. The men of our tribe have begun to adapt themselves to the new
condition of things and are beginning to do most of the work in the fields.
In the domestic government of the tribe before the United States
government interfered with us, the punishment for stealing was that a
man had to restore twice the value of what he stole to the one he stole
from. The penalty for murder was usually banishment. It was a severe
punishment. The rules with regard to young girls was very strict. A girl
was not allowed to go anywhere without an older woman with her and a
girl could not speak to any man excepting her own immediate relatives.
Laughing or talking aloud in public was frowned upon as being
unmaidenly. At home we children were not allowed to speak unless we
were spoken to when visitors were present and never to pass in front of
anyone. The Indians are very courteous to visitors, but all their forms are
so opposite to your own that it would be hard for you to understand
them. For instance it is considered very rude to ask a man his name.
When food is set before you you are expected to eat it all or carry away
with you what you do not eat, and that also arose from courtesy. But my
paper is already too long and I cannot stop to explain the why and
wherefore. I will only say in addition that a guest is expected by his host
to look on the whole house as belonging to him and the whole
household as at his service and they carry out this idea literally. The
hostess herself waits personally on her guests in everything relating to
their comfort.
The generosity of the Indians is almost a vice. It prevents them from
being thrifty and from accumulating. A man is considered great
according to what he has given away and not according to what he has.
Every year we had a harvest feast lasting three days. Whoever chose to
do so gave a horse or as many horses as he wished to give, and these
horses were given to the poorest man in the tribe. When a calamity
occurs to a family all the members of his band make up to them what
they have lost. A family

on our reserve was burnt out by a prairie fire and a house and barn were
lost and the value of them was made up to him by his band. Another
family camped in a valley and struck by a water-spout and the tent was
swept away and the grandmother was drowned. His band gave him
seven horses where he had had none before. Sometimes I think you
white people do not know how to love each other as we Indians do, but
then you see we have nothing in the world but each other. The love
between parents and children is very tender, and there are numerous
instances of men and women

By sending to the undersigned, arrangements could be made for public
meetings in Churches or Halls, as may be found convenient. Collections
may be taken up at the meetings, and thus no risk would be incurred by
any one. If preferred, lecture committees could make arrangements at a
stipulated price, which would be very moderate.
The Churches of New York, Philadelphia, Baltimore, &c., without
distinction of denomination, have welcomed Mr. Tibbles and Miss Bright
Eyes (daughter of the head Chief of the Omaha tribe) with very large
audiences composed of the best people of those cities.
