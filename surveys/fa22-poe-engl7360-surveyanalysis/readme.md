## Summary of Module
This module introduces students to the tools and data available on the DataLab interface from the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES). To wrap up discussions on data ethics, social science research methods, and survey design, this module will explore survey analysis with particular emphasis on creating tables and comparing variables from established datasets. DataLab, a web-based statistical analysis tool, allows students to use national educational survey results to create new statistical analyses of different variables, from early childhood education up to adult education. Focusing on higher education, this module demonstrates how to use the DataLab tool and critical questions that can (and can not) be asked by using this tool.

## Learning Goals
-Understand data collection from National Center for Education Statistics
-Learn how to use the NCES DataLab tool to run statistical analyses on existing educational study data
-Think critically about research questions and interests on a larger, national or database level, connecting local concerns to a larger population.
