# Corpus Building and Computational Text Analysis
## This module will go over: 
- What text analysis is and how it can be useful for environmental politics
- How certain browser text analysis tools could be useful by giving students a test set to run on each tool.
- Understand and differentiate between text analysis and Natural Language Processing

## Summary of Module
This module goes over the basics of text analysis and why it can be useful for environmental politics research. Students learn abotu Natural Language Processing and have time to practice NLP using a test data set. This module provides directions for how to run NLP using Python.

## Learning Objectives
-  Learn how to put text in Python
- Define tokenization, term frequency, stop words, concordance, sentiment
- Practice NLP using a test set of data 
- Understand what text analysis is compared to NLP
- Explore how NLP, and text analysis more broadly, can be useful for environmental politics research
