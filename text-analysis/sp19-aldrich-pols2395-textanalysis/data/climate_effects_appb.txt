Appendix B: Regional Maps

Appendix B.

Regional Maps

Section B.1 through B.10 provides regional maps of annual and seasonal temperature, and seasonal precipitation illustrating the
USGCRP data discussed and tabulated in Section 3 of the report. The precipitation maps were constructed using one-decimal-pointfiner precision than that provided in the tables. This information is based on a new analyses of the CMIP3 database of the climate
model integrations compiled by Michael Wehner of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory used in the USGCRP (2009) report
and is relative to a 1961-1979 baseline. See Section 2 and Appendix A of the report for further details of the methodology.
Section B.11 illustrates projected mean annual and seasonal temperature anomalies relative to the 1971 to 2000 baseline based on the
average of statistically downscaled projections from 16 global climate models. Section 2 and Appendix A of this report provide
further details of the methodology used in developing these maps.
