Mangroves, once kept in check by bitter winter nights in coastal central Florida, are displacing salt marshes, with uncertain ecological implications.Much of the Florida shoreline was once too cold for the tropical trees called mangroves, but the plants are now spreading northward at a rapid clip, scientists reported Monday. That finding is the latest indication that global warming, though still in its early stages, is already leading to ecological changes so large they can be seen from space.Mangroves, once kept in check by bitter winter nights in coastal central Florida, are displacing salt marshes, with uncertain ecological implications.
