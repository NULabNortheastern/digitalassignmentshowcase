Chicago Metropolitan Statistical Area Priority Climate
Action Plan
The purpose of this Priority Climate Action Plan is to articulate plans for strategic climate action that will
support equitable investment in policies, practices, and technologies that reduce pollutant emissions,
create high-quality jobs, spur economic growth, and enhance the quality of life in the greater Chicago
Metropolitan Statistical Area.
The intent of the Priority Climate Action Plan (PCAP) is to enable jurisdictions throughout the Chicago
Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) to seek federal funding under the United States Environmental
Protection Agency’s (EPA) Climate Pollution Reduction Grants (CPRG) Implementation Grant General
Competition and other funding streams, as applicable to implement Priority Green House Gas (GHG)
Reduction Strategies. The strategies contained herein should be construed as broadly available to any
entity within the Chicago MSA eligible to receive funding.
This project has been funded wholly or in part by the United States Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA) under assistance agreement 00E03470 to the Metropolitan Mayors Caucus. The contents of this
document do not necessarily reflect the views and policies of the EPA, nor does the EPA endorse trade
names or recommend the use of commercial products mentioned in this document.

Acknowledgements
The Metropolitan Mayors Caucus gratefully acknowledges the generous, expert support of the Chicago
Metropolitan Agency for Planning (CMAP) in developing the Priority Climate Action Plan (PCAP). CMAP
demonstrated exceptional commitment to the quality and success of the PCAP and related CPRG
products and activities.
We appreciate the partnership of the Northwestern Indiana Regional Planning Commission (NIRPC) in
developing the PCAP. Both CMAP and NIRPC will continue to collaborate to complete the
Comprehensive Climate Action Plan (CCAP) in June 2025. The Metropolitan Mayors Caucus also enjoyed
collaboration with the Southeastern Wisconsin Regional Planning Commission (SEWRPC), the City of
Chicago, City of Aurora, City of Geneva, DuPage County, the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency,
Kane County, City of Kenosha, City of Naperville, and Village of Oak Park to plan the PCAP process. The
Kankakee-Iroquois Regional Planning Commission (KIRPC) and State of Wisconsin expressed their
support and willingness to collaborate. Many other local government agencies, private sector and civic
organizations were engaged in and supportive of the PCAP process as described in the Stakeholder
Engagement Section 1.3.3.
The Metropolitan Mayors Caucus is deeply grateful to the EPA who has made this extraordinary
opportunity for coordinated, strategic, and inclusive climate action available, not just to the region, but
to states, metropolitan regions, tribes, and territories across the United States. The EPA made a dazzling
number of rich technical resources, tools and support available to all organizations developing PCAPs for
the Planning Phase of the Climate Pollution Reduction Grant Program. Without the guidance and deep
technical expertise of the EPA both nationally and within EPA’s Region 5, the Priority Climate Action Plan
would not have been possible in this short amount of time. Efforts made by EPA’s CPRG team to train
and support public leaders at state, local, and tribal levels will have an enduring impact on our nation’s
ability to meaningfully address the climate crisis while supporting thriving communities.

Chicago MSA PCAP 3/1/2024

The Metropolitan Mayors Caucus (Caucus), a non-profit regional council of governments inclusive of 275
municipalities in northeastern Illinois, is the lead agency for the Climate Pollution Reduction Planning
Grant for the Chicago MSA. The Executive Board of the Caucus is strongly supportive of climate action
and the Caucus’ leadership role in regional climate action, especially under the leadership of Executive
Board Chairman and Environment Committee Chairman Kevin Burns, Mayor of the City of Geneva.
The Caucus’ membership has demonstrated both commitments and effective action as adopters of the
Greenest Region Compact, the Caucus’ sustainability pledge and program endorsed by 153+
municipalities, 5 counties and 10 sub-regional councils of government. Such comprehensive climate
action planning, as required for the PCAP, would not be possible without their support and engagement.
Finally, we appreciate the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) who contributed
substantially to prepare the Metropolitan Mayors Caucus and member municipalities to plan for
strategic climate action. Because of NOAA’s assistance in preparing the 2021 Climate Action Plan for the
Chicago region, we are ready and able to lead the CPRG planning work for our region.

Chicago MSA PCAP 3/1/2024

1 Introduction
1.1 CPRG overview
As a part of the Inflation Reduction Act, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is implementing
the historic the Climate Pollution Reduction Grant program in partnership with states, local
governments, territories and tribes to ensure the health and well-being of Americans and to support
global initiatives to mitigate climate impacts through the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and
other harmful air pollutants.

1.1.1 Phase 1 – Planning
The Climate Pollution Reduction Grant program is providing funds to 46 states and some 67 of the
nation’s largest MSAs to develop and implement plans for achieving CPRG objectives. The Metropolitan
Mayors Caucus was awarded a $1 million Planning Grant to complete the planning requirements of
CPRG for the Chicago MSA over a four-year period beginning in 2023. This PCAP is the first of these
CPRG planning products.
The State of Illinois was awarded a $3 million Planning Grant to complete the planning requirements of
CPRG for the State over a similar timeframe. The State of Wisconsin and the State of Indiana also
accepted CPRG Planning Grants. Successful completion of these complementary regional and state
PCAPs allows jurisdictions covered by these plans to be eligible to compete for grants through the $4.6
billion CPRG Implementation Grant Program.
Each state and MSA participating in the CPRG Planning grant program must complete these three
climate planning products. The Metropolitan Mayors Caucus (Caucus) is collaborating with CMAP and
NIRPC to produce these elements for the Chicago MSA following this timeline:
1. Priority Climate Action Plan (PCAP), due March 1, 2024
2. Comprehensive Climate Action Plan (CCAP), due June 2025
3. Status Report, due June 2027
The Caucus has led in the production of this document, the PCAP.
CMAP will lead in developing the CCAP. This narrative report will provide an overview of the region’s
significant GHG sources/sinks and sectors, establish near-term and long-term GHG emission reduction
goals, and provide strategies and measures that address the highest priority sectors to meet those goals.
The CCAP will include a comprehensive inventory of emissions and sinks for the following sectors:
industry, electricity generation and use, transportation, commercial and residential buildings,
agriculture, natural and working lands, and waste and materials management.
CMAP will collaborate with the Caucus to produce the Status Report.

1.1.2 Phase 2 – Implementation
The Priority GHG Reduction Strategies identified by the PCAP guide the eligibility of proposed projects
for competitive CPRG Implementation funding, subject to review by the EPA. Any eligible jurisdiction
within the Chicago MSA may apply for CPRG Implementation funding for projects that address Priority
GHG Reduction Strategies in either this PCAP, or their respective state plan – Illinois, Indiana, or
Wisconsin.

Chicago MSA PCAP 3/1/2024

The U.S. EPA Notice of Funding Opportunity for CPRG Implementation Grants describes eligible
applicants: states, municipalities, air pollution control agencies, tribes, territories, and groups thereof.
Lead organizations that directly received a CPRG planning grant, including the Caucus are eligible to
apply for an implementation grant.

1.2 PCAP Overview
This PCAP for the Chicago MSA includes these elements:
•

•
•
•

Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Inventory – a comprehensive accounting of greenhouse gas emission
sources and sinks
Priority GHG Reduction Strategies– a subset of the Complete List of GHG Reduction Strategies
for which specific measures and their GHG reduction impacts are quantified. These Strategies
are likely to be implemented with the 5-year CPRG period.
Low Income / Disadvantaged Communities (LIDAC) Benefits Analysis - identification of low
income and disadvantaged communities and analyses of impacts from implementation of GHG
Reduction Strategies
Intersection with Other Funding Availability
Review of Authority to Implement Each GHG Reduction Strategy
Next steps – includes a full list of GHG Reduction Strategies for long term implementation.

•
•

In addition, the 2021 Climate Action Plan for the Chicago Region provides additional elements
that may inform policymakers and stakeholders. As this CAP was completed prior to CPRG, these
elements are not inclusive of the entire Chicago MSA but are helpful for reference and for
understanding the GHG Reduction Strategies included in this PCAP.
GHG emission projections
GHG reduction targets

•

•

Additional information on the PCAP elements can be found in EPA’s CPRG: Formula Grants for Planning,
Program Guidance for States, Municipalities, and Air Control Agencies.
Additionally, supplemental information follows in Appendices A-G.

1.3 Approach to Developing the PCAP
The CPRG program offers the greater Chicago region the opportunity to build upon fundamental climate
action planning while extending the breadth and scope of previous plans for greater emissions reduction
impacts and greater benefits to communities. Engagement of diverse jurisdictions and stakeholders
across the state lines sparked innovation and collaboration to significantly reduce GHG emissions. The
diversity of community types and size across the 14 counties stretched our thinking about climate action
at this scale.
The CPRG Implementation grants offer an enormous opportunity to implement priority actions at an
expansive scale. This prospect greatly influenced the development of the PCAP and the selection of
Priority GHG Emission Strategies. The rapid timeline for CPRG planning reflects the urgency of the
climate crisis and underscores the imperative of quick, coordinated action to mitigate climate change.

10

Chicago MSA PCAP 3/1/2024

1.3.1 Existing Climate Action Plans
To create the Chicago MSA PCAP, the team drew on existing climate action plans prepared for localities
in the MSA.
The Metropolitan Mayors Caucus (Caucus) developed the first Climate Action Plan for the Chicago
Region (CAP) with assistance from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) in
2021. The European Union and the Global Covenant of Mayors mentored the Caucus to create the plan
as one of 3 model regional climate action plans in the United States. The CAP was recognized with
several awards including a Climate Leadership Award through the Center for Climate and Energy
Solutions (C2ES), awards from American Planning Association at both the national and state level, an
award from the American Society of Landscape Architects, Illinois Chapter, as well as one from the
Morton Arboretum.
The Climate Action Plan for the Chicago Region was based on the 2015 GHG inventory conducted by the
Chicago Metropolitan Agency for Planning (CMAP) for the 7-county metropolitan region. The CAP
addresses equity, mitigation, and adaptation. It identifies 8 climate mitigation (GHG Reduction)
objectives and 42 GHG reduction strategies. These objectives form the framework for the strategies of
the PCAP. All CAP strategies are included in the PCAP, and some were split into more precise strategies
to suit further planning and regional implementation approaches.
Uniquely, the 2021 CAP was tailored for municipal action to serve the municipal members of the
Metropolitan Mayors Caucus who embraced regional leadership on climate action early. To be more
expansive in GHG reduction and to be more inclusive of regional jurisdictions and stakeholders, the GHG
reduction strategies for the PCAP plans for engagement of transit agencies, water utilities and other
local and regional governments.
Many high-quality climate action plans produced by constituent communities provided important inputs
into the PCAP. The City of Chicago crafted its 2022 Chicago Climate Action Plan with a vision of justice
and equity. The Chicago plan is based on its 2017 GHG inventory and developed GHG reduction
strategies around 5 pillars. The recent and robust stakeholder engagement of the Chicago plan informs
the PCAP. Other municipal climate action plans that inform the PCAP include the Village of Oak Park’s
Climate Ready Oak Park, the Village of Northbrook’s Climate Action Plan. Kane County has completed
the draft Kane County Climate Action Plan at the time of this publication.
Northwestern Indiana Regional Planning Commission (NIRPC) created the Northwest Indiana Climate
Action Framework with GHG reduction strategies in 7 focus areas. The plan is based on their 2017 GHG
inventory and provides critical insights for the PCAP to serves NW Indiana given their unique industrial
economy. NIRPC’s draft long-range plan, NWI 2050+, provides an emissions profile and recognizes the
need to reduce emissions and prepare for climate change.
The Chicago Metropolitan Agency for Planning (CMAP) has done fundamental work to prepare for
climate action planning including GHG inventories every 5 years since 2010. The most recent 2019
Chicago Regional GHG inventory also led to local emissions profiles that enable local climate planning.
Recognizing the scale and urgency of climate change, ON TO 2050, the region’s long-range plan adopted
in 2018 and updated in 2022, establishes goals and strategies for the CMAP region to both intensify
mitigation efforts and prepare for the current and projected impacts of climate change. CMAP’s
Strategic Direction (2023) defines the agency’s five-year plan to advance the recommendations of ON

11

Chicago MSA PCAP 3/1/2024

TO 2050. One of its three goals is “a region that takes action to mitigate and adapt to the impacts of
climate change and preserve high-quality water resources.”

1.3.2 PCAP Team
The Metropolitan Mayors Caucus has led the preparation of the Priority Climate Action Plan for the
Chicago MSA.
CMAP has contributed invaluable assistance in the completion of the greenhouse gas inventory for the
Chicago MSA on which priority GHG reduction strategies are based. CMAP also contributed the Low
Income and Disadvantaged Communities Analysis portion of this PCAP and identified additional regional
GHG reduction strategies to improve upon the Climate Action Plan for the Chicago Region. CMAP
quantified many of the Priority GHG Reduction Strategies. CMAP also completed the Quality Assurance
Project Plan (QAPP) as required by the CPRG program.
NIRPC contributed GHG data and guided in selection of priority strategies. Illinois Environmental
Protection Agency coordinated in the development of the PCAP and covers important Priority GHG
Reduction Strategies not included in this PCAP.

1.3.3 Stakeholder Engagement
Robust stakeholder engagement in the recent creation of the Climate Action Plan for the Chicago
Region, the 2022 Chicago Climate Action Plan, Northwest Indiana Climate Action Framework, and other
climate planning referenced above provided a solid foundation for the development of the PCAP. The
Climate Action Plan for the Chicago Region engaged 270 people from 175 organizations including 53
diverse municipalities in the Chicago region, of which 16 are environmental justice communities (LIDAC).
The City of Chicago gathered input from 2,100 residents and Kane County has gathered input from 1,100
residents to create their respective climate action plans.
The Caucus utilized the Environment Committee, comprised of municipal representatives and allies from
throughout the region, to educate and solicit input about the CPRG program and PCAP development.
Members of the Environment Committee include mayors, other elected officials, municipal staff, citizen
commissioners and allies from other branches of government and the civic community. Low income and
disadvantaged communities throughout the region are well-represented on the Environment
Committee. Stakeholder engagement to develop the PCAP are summarized here:
May 16, 2023, the Environment Committee of the Metropolitan Mayors Caucus held a meeting to
discuss CPRG. More than 50 municipal officials and civic leaders attended the online meeting.
May 23, 2023, CMAP hosted a meeting of the County Chairpersons representing the 7-county region.
CPRG information was presented and discussed.
December 6, 2023, CMAP announced that Climate Action Townhall through its newsletter, received by
24,000 people, and created an online survey to solicit implementation project ideas and foster
collaboration.
December 18, 2023, CMAP and the Caucus jointly hosted the Climate Action Townhall with Illinois EPA
and NIRPC participating as presenters. One-hundred and sixty people from throughout the MSA
attended.
January 16, 2024, the Environment Committee of the Metropolitan Mayors Caucus held a meeting to
help prioritize GHG reduction strategies and hear presentations from likely applicants for CPRG

12

Chicago MSA PCAP 3/1/2024

Implementation funding. More than 60 stakeholders attended and gave input into the development of 5
potential implementation projects. The online engagement tool, Mentimeter, was used to solicit
feedback and rank project ideas.
February 24, 2024, The Caucus used an online survey to solicit stakeholder feedback on the draft Priority
GHG Reduction Strategies. Seventeen respondents generally concurred with draft strategies, and a few
made helpful comments.
A sign-on letter requesting that an e-bike incentive program be covered as a Priority GHG Reduction
Strategy was received by CMAP, the Caucus and the City of Chicago. This letter was signed by:
350 Chicago
Active Transportation Alliance
Better Streets Chicago
Chicago Cycling Club

Major Taylor Cycling Club of Chicago
McHenry County Bicycle Advocates
McHenry County Century Ride
Metropolitan Planning Council
Natural Resources Defense Council

Sierra Club Illinois Chapter
West Town Bikes NFP
The very short PCAP timeline and the large scale of the PCAP project prohibited more extensive and inperson stakeholder engagement across the Chicago MSA. Stakeholder engagement will continue and
will deepen over the next CCAP planning phase of CPRG.

1.3.4 Identifying and Quantifying GHG Reduction Strategies
The 2021 Climate Action Plan for the Chicago Region compiled GHG reduction strategies (called
Mitigation Strategies). Forty-two strategies were identified and categorized into eight Mitigation (GHG
Reduction) Objectives based on these inputs:
•

13

Analysis of 31 local sustainability plans and 25 municipal climate action plans from the United
States cities and Europe.

Chicago MSA PCAP 3/1/2024

•
•

Use of the CURB (Climate Action for Urban Sustainability) tool to categorize and evaluate
actions.
Input from 270 stakeholders representing 175 organizations.

Mitigation strategies in the 2021 CAP were tailored for municipal action to serve the municipal members
of the Metropolitan Mayors Caucus who embraced leadership on climate action early.
Strategies (renamed GHG Reduction Strategies) compiled for the PCAP are more inclusive of regional
jurisdictions and more expansive in GHG reduction potential. While the short timeframe prohibited
thorough stakeholder engagement, input and ideas were solicited as described above and incorporated.
CMAP also conducted its own review of 20 climate action and sustainability plans including 9 not
reviewed for the CAP. CMAP staff also convened in-house subject matter experts to evaluate strategies
and identify new ones. Notable additions include strategies related to transit, vehicle traffic, freight, and
industry.
The Complete List of GHG Reduction Strategies contains 67 strategies organized into 8 GHG Reduction
Objectives. These objectives are:
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.
6.
7.
8.

Demonstrate Leadership
Decarbonize Energy Sources
Optimize Building Energy
Implement Clean Energy Policies
Decarbonize Transportation
Reduce Vehicle Miles Traveled
Manage Water and Waste Sustainably
Sustain Ecosystems to Sequester Carbon

Priority Strategies are categorized in context of their overarching Objective and highlighted in the
Complete List of GHG Reduction Strategies (in blue). See Complete List of GHG Reduction Strategies
Section 6.
Many additional GHG Reduction Strategies are offered as guidance to all stakeholders in the Chicago
MSA for planning and implementation beyond the scope of PCAP. These additional strategies will serve
as a foundation for further planning, stakeholder engagement and refinement in the CCAP.
Priority GHG Reduction Strategies are exclusively selected as vehicles to allow eligible organizations
within the Chicago MSA to apply for CPRG Implementation Grants. CMAP led stakeholder engagement
to solicit CPRG Implementation project ideas as the foundation for the selection of Priority GHG
Reduction Strategies. An online survey was widely distributed beginning December 6, 2023, and
remained open through the end of January 2024. A total of 25 responses were received. Follow up
conversations with these stakeholders allowed scoping of viable project ideas and the forming of
coalitions to champion Priority GHG Reduction Strategies.
Project ideas were evaluated for consistency with CPRG program priorities. These criteria included
subjective evaluation of:
•
•
•
•
14

Benefits to low income and disadvantaged communities (LIDAC)
Feasible implementation in 5 years
High or highly effective GHG reduction potential
Innovation and potential for transformation

Chicago MSA PCAP 3/1/2024

•

Funding gaps or funding insufficiency prohibiting the project from advancing without CPRG
funding

Both CMAP and the Caucus met with key constituents to brainstorm to conceive CPRG implementation
projects and guide in the identification of enabling priority reduction strategies. These include:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

A coalition of counties and municipalities led by Kane County
American Lung Association
Chicago-Area Wastewater Utility Consortium led by Wheaton Sanitary District
City of Chicago
Chicago Public Schools, Chicago Park District, Chicago Housing Authority
ComEd
Cook County
County transportation planners
Drive Clean Indiana
Governors State University
Illinois Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 701
Illinois Alliance for Clean Transportation
Illinois Landscape Contractors Association
Lake County
Lake Michigan Air Directors Consortium (LADCO)
Metropolitan Planning Council
Metra commuter rail
Regional Transportation Authority
Sub-regional councils of government

In addition, advocates representing electric micromobility, food waste, and circular economy interests
contributed ideas for priority reduction strategies.
Strategies from the draft Complete list of GHG Reduction Strategies were refined and adapted to
sufficiently address the projects that constituent groups intend to propose for CPRG Implementation
funding. With further coordination and another online survey (February 24, 2024) the 13 Priority GHG
Reduction Strategies were finalized. These are presented in Section 5, Priority GHG Reduction Strategies.
Many GHG reduction strategies of great importance to the region are not named “Priority GHG
Reduction Strategies” in this PCAP. To clarify, Priority GHG Reduction Strategies included in the PCAP are
so defined because they will enable projects that meet CPRG criteria to compete for CPRG
implementation funding.
Important strategies to electrifying transportation through policy and investment are not included
because there are several other robust funding opportunities available beyond CPRF. These include NEVI
funds from the U.S. Joint Office of Energy and Transportation, NEVI funds through federal and State
grants, vehicle rebates from the State of Illinois, and rebates through ComEd’s Beneficial Electrification
program. Important investments in active transportation to reduce vehicle miles traveled are not
included because they cannot be completed in the CPRG timeframe and cannot demonstrate high GHG
reductions through mode shift. Building energy policies are a regional priority but are not included as
priorities because other sources of federal funding through Department of Energy are available and in

fact, have been awarded to the Chicago area. Any eligible jurisdiction within the Chicago MSA may
apply for CPRG grant funds to address Priority Strategies that alternatively appear in their respective
state PCAPs - Illinois, Indiana, or Wisconsin.
Other strategies are included as Priority GHG Reduction Strategies at the request of project champions,
despite relatively modest GHG reduction potential, or access to other funding sources. Helping low- and
moderate-income households access energy efficiency and electrification benefits is one of these
championed project ideas. Therefore, BE1 and BE2 strategies for residential energy efficiency and
residential electrification were elevated as priorities. Similarly, constituents expressed strong support
for an e-bike rebate program proposal. Therefore, VMT11 for electric micromobility systems was
elevated as a priority.
Each of the 13 Priority GHG Reduction Strategies were analyzed and quantified for CPRG program
compliance. At least one representative measure was chosen for each Priority Strategy and that
measure was quantified using tools and models available from U.S. EPA, the National Renewable Energy
Laboratory (NREL), the Rocky Mountain Institute (RMI), and others. ComEd used its own validated
modeling tool for energy efficiency and electrification strategies. CMAP conducted thorough
quantification exercises for nine of the priority measures. Organizations championing future CPRG
projects conducted additional quantification exercises. Quantification results are presented in Section 5
and full methodology is described in Appendix A.
The key purpose of the quantification exercise is to demonstrate GHG reduction potential and validate
the selection of these thirteen Priority GHG Reduction Strategies.

1.4 Scope of the PCAP
This PCAP serves the entire Chicago-NapervilleElgin, IL-WI-IN MSA, including Illinois counties
Cook, DeKalb, DuPage, Grundy, Kane, Kendall,
Lake, McHenry and Will; Indiana counties of Lake,
Porter, Jasper, and Newton; and the Wisconsin
county of Kenosha. It has a total population of
9,618,502. The Chicago MSA is the third largest
among 67 MSA’s eligible to receive a Phase 1
Planning Grant through the CPRG program.
The Priority Actions are guided by the needs of the
constituents and capability of jurisdictions within
the region to reduce emissions from these sectors:
1. transportation
2. residential electricity and natural gas usage
3. commercial, (electricity and natural gas
usage)
4. industrial (electricity usage, natural gas
usage
5. industrial processes
6. energy generation agriculture
7. waste
8. wastewater

16

Chicago MSA PCAP 3/1/2024

The PCAP considers existing authorities and capacity of the jurisdictions eligible for CPRG
Implementation funds including municipalities, counties, transit agencies, water utilities, and groups
thereof and the metropolitan planning organization to implement priority climate actions, often in
partnership with others in the private and civic sectors. Each Strategy is paired with both “Key
Implementers” and “Authority to Implement” as a planning aid. The Chicago MSA PCAP is coordinated
with relevant State PCAPs, references state authority and implementation partnership but does not
identify strategies for state implementation.
Greenhouse gas reduction strategies include a range of actions that can be undertaken by local and
regional government agencies including policies, programs, and capital projects. Strategies identify
needs for collaboration and partnership across jurisdictions and with the private sector.

2 Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Inventory
To inform the development of the Chicago MSA PCAP, CMAP completed a greenhouse gas (GHG)
emissions inventory for the 14 counties in the Chicago MSA (2020 Chicago MSA inventory).
This section provides an overview of the methodology used to develop the inventory and details 2020
GHG emissions by both sector and relevant subsectors, reports total and per-capita emissions by county,
and reflects upon previous GHG inventories and trends.
The process by which emission sources and sinks are identified and quantified within the planning
geography is critical to the climate action planning process and will help the region identify and assess
GHG reduction measures, conduct benefit analyses, and both set and track progress toward its emission
reduction targets. The GHG inventory was developed in accordance with U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA) guidance provided via the Climate Pollution Reduction Grant program, as reflected in the
Appendix C.

2.1.1 Methodology - Underlying data
The 2020 Chicago MSA Greenhouse Gas Inventory includes 2020 county-level emissions data for three
major GHGs: carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide. CMAP chose the year 2020 because it was the
most recent year available across the geography. 1 CMAP also reviewed past inventories for northeastern
Illinois (2019) and northwestern Indiana (2017).
The 2020 Chicago MSA Greenhouse Gas Inventory covers emissions from eight sectors: transportation
residential electricity and natural gas usage), commercial, (electricity and natural gas usage), industrial
(electricity usage, natural gas usage, and emissions from industrial processes), energy generation,
agriculture, waste, and wastewater. It also estimates carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) removed due to

1 Pandemic-related changes in transportation and energy consumption make 2020 an anomalous year for some

datasets, but it is still a viable year for this analysis. The inventory is built using modeled and reported data from
various time scales and geographies, which reduces the impacts of short-term fluctuations, such as those
experienced in 2020. The inventory results are comparable to past efforts to study emissions in the region.

2.2 Emissions calculation by sector
To calculate emissions for each sector, CMAP used the U.S. EPA’s Local Greenhouse Gas Inventory Tool
(LGGIT) for community-wide inventories, following guidance outlined in the U.S. EPA Climate Pollution
Reduction Grant Program.3
Commercial, residential, and industry sector stationary energy emissions include emissions resulting
from grid-supplied electricity and natural gas used for heat, steam, cooling, and other processes.
Calculations for these emissions used data on electricity and natural gas fuel consumption supplied by
the Department of Energy (DOE) and National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL)SLOPE tool, 4 as well
as the U.S. EPA Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program (GHGRP).5 Emissions from electricity used in the
region were calculated using the U.S. EPA Emissions and Generation Resource Integrated Database
(eGRID),6 which discloses environmental characteristics of electricity generated in the multi-state
electrical transmission region.

2 This inventory does not include emissions from interregional aviation. Additional carbon sinks will be explored

during the CCAP.

Chicago MSA PCAP 3/1/2024

The Chicago MSA is part of the RFCW eGRID subregion which extends into Indiana, Ohio, and West
Virginia.7 In 2021, electricity in this eGRID was produced by several different sources: natural gas (27.7
percent), coal (35.6 percent), and nuclear (28.5 percent). 8 Compared to the rest of the nation, the RFCW
eGRID’s fuel mix includes significantly larger contributions from both nuclear and coal, and less in
natural gas. Notably, wind, solar, and geothermal represent a much smaller portion of the region’s fuel
mix (5.5 percent combined) than the national average (12.4 percent). Methods for analyzing different
portions of the MSA region, such as the smaller ComEd region, accounting for local variations in energy
generation, were not available for the entire region at the time the inventory was conducted.
Emissions for the transportation sector were calculated using results from the National Emissions
Inventory (NEI),9 and captured mobile sources, including on-road emissions, non-road equipment,
locomotives, and commercial marine vessels.
Emissions from the waste sector were calculated using the U.S. EPA Facility Level Information on
Greenhouse Gases Tool (FLIGHT), 10 a publicly accessible database that reports on large GHG emissions
sources. The FLIGHT tool reports carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide emissions in CO2e using
the Global Warming Potential Values, 11 which allows for comparisons of global warming impacts of
different gases. These values were informed by a report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change (IPCC). The Chicago MSA Greenhouse Gas Inventory uses the conversion values from the IPCC’s
fifth assessment report. However, the FLIGHT tool uses values from the IPCC fourth assessment report,
which differ from the conversion values used in this inventory. As a result, these values were converted
to raw emissions values and then into CO2e using the fifth assessment report rates for this inventory.
Emissions associated with biogas emissions from wastewater treatment facilities within the MSA region
were calculated and scaled based on data provided by the Metropolitan Water Reclamation District
(MWRD). This data was utilized to calculate kilograms of methane and nitrous oxide per person for the
CMAP region. Since data from all wastewater treatment plants in the region were not available, CMAP
used MWRD methane and nitrous oxide per-person rates to scale wastewater sector biogas emissions to
the MSA level based on county population totals from the 2020 U.S. Census.
Agriculture emissions from fertilizer consumption are scaled from the agriculture module of the U.S. EPA
State Inventory Tool (SIT).12 This dataset lists total nitrogen consumption in metric tons by state. After
state-level data was calculated, it was downscaled to the county level using the proportion of state
cropland acreage found within each of the counties in the MSA region. Total cropland acres in each
relevant county and state were downloaded from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)’s
QuickStats database.13

7 The 27 eGRID subregions in the U.S. are defined by EPA using data from the Energy Information Administration

(EIA) and the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC). The subregions are defined to limit the
amount of imports and exports across regions in order to best represent the electricity used in each of the
subregions.

All emissions within the inventory are expressed in million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent
(MMTCO2e). Appendix C provides more information on the methodology used to convert emissions
across the various sectors included in this inventory into this standard format.

2.3 2020 Chicago MSA Greenhouse Gas Inventory
In 2020, the 14 counties in the Chicago MSA produced approximately 160 million metric tons of carbon
dioxide equivalent (MMTCO2e) of GHG emissions. Figure 1 provides the greenhouse gas emissions
inventory for the Chicago MSA region, broken down by the following sectors: transportation, residential
buildings, commercial buildings, industry, energy generation, agriculture, waste, and wastewater. Figure
2 provides the same information, broken down by subsector and highlights the relative contributions of
electricity and natural gas across the building sectors. Figure 3 rank orders the subsectors based on
greatest to least share of the total inventory.
Figure 1. Greenhouse gas emissions in the Chicago MSA region by sector, 2020

Source: CMAP, 2024.

The MSA’s GHG inventory shows that two prominent emission sectors — industry and transportation —
comprise over 50 percent of total emissions. This is likely due to the region’s important role as national
transportation and manufacturing hubs. The Chicago region is home to 10 interstate highways, 6 Class I
railroads, one of the nation’s busiest air-cargo hubs, and the only maritime connection between the St.
Lawrence Seaway and the Mississippi River system. These transportation resources directly produce
greenhouse gas emissions and make the region an ideal location for industry. The Chicago region’s
current and historical role as manufacturing and transportation centers, combined with its dependance
on fossil fuels, make the region a major contributor to the United States’ total GHG output.
Approximately 23 percent of regional emissions come from transportation. On-road transportation,
which includes public and private cars, buses, and trucks, is overwhelmingly the largest source of
transportation emissions (85 percent) and is the single largest subsector overall. Approximately 64
percent of transportation emissions come from light duty vehicles, such as private cars, SUVs, and small

20

Chicago MSA PCAP 3/1/2024

trucks. An additional 21 percent of transportation emissions come from heavy duty vehicles such as
large trucks. See Figure 2 for more detail. Other transportation sources include non-road equipment,
locomotives, and commercial marine vessels.
Figure 2. Greenhouse gas emissions in the Chicago MSA region by subsector, 2020

Source: CMAP, 2024.

Industrial emissions from electricity and natural gas use and processes account for 28.9 percent of the
MSA’s total emissions. Within industry, natural gas use accounts for approximately 27 percent and
electricity use accounts for about 25 percent of GHG emissions. Industrial processes account for
approximately 48 percent of all industry sector GHG emissions. Approximately 81 percent of industrial
process emissions are a result of iron and steel production. See Figure 2, below. Only three counties
within the Chicago MSA region (Lake County, IN; Porter County, IN; and Cook County, IL) produce
emissions from iron and steel production.
Emissions from commercial and residential buildings are also notable, as shown in Figure 2. Commercial
buildings, including institutional buildings, accounted for 23.1 percent of all emissions, while residential
buildings accounted for 18.7 percent. This is likely due to the region’s northern climate, leading to
significant heating and cooling needs, as well as regional concentrations of older building stock. Within
the residential buildings sector, natural gas use accounts for approximately 61 percent of emissions
while electricity use accounts for 39 percent. Within the commercial buildings sector, natural gas use
accounts for about 38 percent of GHG emissions while electricity use accounts for 62 percent.
Energy generation emissions, or emissions from the power sector not directly attributable to consumers,
account for an additional 5 percent of emissions. Agriculture (0.4 percent), waste (0.7 percent), and
wastewater (0.1 percent) are the smallest shares of the overall GHG emissions inventory, shown in
Figure 2. Carbon sequestration, focused on trees and forestlands, removed an estimated 1.49
MMTCO2e in 2020.

Figure 3. Greenhouse gas emissions in the Chicago MSA region by subsector, listed in order of greatest to least
share of the total inventory, 2020

Emissions from electricity generation — serving residential, commercial, and industrial buildings —
account for 34 percent of total emissions. Natural gas emissions associated with onsite residential,
commercial, and industrial sector fuel use account for 28 percent of total emissions. Most emissions in
the transportation sector are associated with gasoline and diesel.14

2.4 Results by county
Figure 4 and Table 2 provide total and per capita GHG emissions respectively at the county level for
2020. Notably, Cook County, IL generated the most emissions of any geography in the region by a
significant margin (40 percent of total emissions, or 64.3 MMTCO2e), followed by Lake County, IN (17
percent, or 27.4 MMT C02e); Will County, IL (9 percent, or 13.8 MMT C02e), and DuPage County, IL (8
percent, or 12.7 MMT CO2e). Newton County, IN produced the least emissions (0.5 MMT C02e),
followed by Jasper County, IN (1.3 MMT C02e).
On a per capita basis, Porter County, IN (73.2 MT C02e/person); Lake County, IN (55 MT C02e/person);
and Grundy County, IL (54.4 MT C02e/person) produced the most emissions per capita. Kendall County,
IL (9.04 MT CO2e/person); McHenry County, IL (11.8 MT C02e/person); and Cook County, IL (12.2 MT
CO2e/person) were the most efficient.

14 Electricity used to power electric vehicles cannot be attributed to the transportation sector at this time.

2.5 Results by state
When viewing Chicago MSA GHG emissions by state, stark differences in the types of regional emissions
come into focus. For example, nearly 85 percent of all industrial emissions are concentrated in Lake
County, IN; Porter County, IN; and Cook County, IL.
Illinois portion of the Chicago MSA
The Illinois portion of the Chicago MSA represents 72 percent of the region’s total GHG emissions and
includes the counties of Cook, DuPage, Kendall, Kane, Lake, McHenry, Will, DeKalb, and Grundy. These
emissions are detailed by subsector in Figure 5.
Generally speaking, emissions attributed to Illinois mirror the rest of the MSA; however, Illinois
industrial emissions represent a much smaller portion of the overall MSA’s emissions profile — a total of
14.3 percent versus 28.9 percent for the total Chicago MSA inventory.
Figure 5. Illinois portion of the Chicago MSA GHG emissions by subsector, 2020.

Source: CMAP, 2024

Figure 6 details the GHG emissions for Cook County, which contributes the greatest share of emissions
(40 percent) among all counties in the Chicago MSA. The percentage of Cook County’s overall emissions
from transportation (25.6 percent) is slightly lower than the total Illinois portion of the MSA (27.1
percent), and its residential and commercial building emissions (59.2 percent of the total) are slightly
higher than the total Illinois portion of the MSA (53.1 percent). For Cook County, these results are likely
due to the comparatively dense land use pattern, high access to the regional transit system, and
significant building heating and cooling needs.

Indiana portion of the Chicago MSA
The Indiana portion of the Chicago MSA represents 26 percent of the total MSA emissions and includes
the counties of Newton, Jasper, Porter, and Lake. As shown in Figure 7, northwest Indiana has a
significantly larger percentage of emissions from industrial energy emissions compared with other parts
of the MSA. The Northwestern Indiana Regional Planning Commission’s (NIRPC) 2017 GHG emissions
inventory attributed over half of the area’s GHG emissions to this source. Similarly, the 2020 Chicago
MSA inventory also found that 48 percent of GHG emissions in the four Indiana counties come from
industrial processes, with additional emissions from industrial electricity and natural gas use for a
combined total of 71 percent of all emissions in these four counties.

25

Chicago MSA PCAP 3/1/2024
Figure 7. Indiana portion of the Chicago MSA GHG emissions by subsector, 2020

Source: CMAP, 2024

Figure 8 provides the emissions inventory by subsector for Lake County, IN. Lake County contributes the
second largest share of greenhouse gas emissions (27.4 percent) among all the counties in the Chicago
MSA region. Notably, however, Lake County’s inventory differs significantly from Cook County’s. Total
industrial emissions in Lake County represent 69 percent of emissions (18.9 MMTCO2e) — considerably
higher than Cook County, where they make up 15 percent (9.5 MMTCO2e) of total emissions. Industrial
processes represent the highest contributing subsector in Lake County (45 percent), compared to only 2
percent for Cook County. In fact, Lake County represents 42 percent of all industrial emissions and 52
percent of all industrial process emissions within the region. Following industrial processes, Lake
County’s highest contributing sectors are transportation (11 percent) and energy generation (9 percent).

Wisconsin portion of the Chicago MSA
The Wisconsin portion of the Chicago MSA represents 1.5 percent of total MSA emissions and includes
Kenosha County. Figure 9 provides the GHG emissions by subsector for this county and highlights very
distinct differences from the regional picture. Compared to the regional inventory, industry accounts for
a relatively small portion of Kenosha County’s greenhouse gas emissions (8.1 vs. 28.9 percent), while
both transportation and commercial building emissions are a greater portion of the overall profile.

2.5.1 Past inventories and trends
The 2020 Chicago MSA inventory was the first conducted for the Chicago MSA, but several previous
inventories for sub-geographies within the MSA can provide key insights into ongoing trends. Most
notably, CMAP references the 2010, 2015, and 2019 GHG emissions inventories for the seven-county
CMAP region and the 2017 GHG emissions inventory for two counties in the NIRPC region. While these
inventories used different methodologies than the 2020 Chicago MSA inventory, they can be useful for
studying high-level trends.
CMAP has been conducting regional GHG emissions inventories every five years since 2010 for the seven
counties in the agency’s jurisdiction: Cook, DuPage, Kane, Kendall, Lake, McHenry, and Will.15 These
inventories follow the Global Protocol for Community-Scale Greenhouse Gas Emission Inventories (GPC)
Basic methodology16 and show emissions at the county level. Consistent with the GPC Basic
methodology, CMAP’s past inventories did not include industrial processes, agriculture, or
sequestration.
CMAP’s previous inventories also differ from the 2020 Chicago MSA inventory in their approach to
building energy. CMAP’s previous inventories used energy use data provided by natural gas and
electricity utilities, rather than EPA data, and applied a region-specific emissions factor to estimate

15 Full inventory available at: https://www.cmap.illinois.gov/data/greenhouse-gas-inventory

Chicago MSA PCAP 3/1/2024

electricity emissions. This custom emissions factor is intended to account for the relatively high
proportion of nuclear energy in the ComEd service area, relative to the larger eGRID region.
The CMAP region’s most recent inventory was conducted for 2019 and included an update of 2010 and
2015 data. As shown in figure 10, the 2019 inventory found a 9 percent emissions decrease between
2010 and 2019. This reduction was due primarily to a transition away from coal in electricity generation,
in favor of lower emissions fuels, including natural gas, solar, and wind. During this same period,
emissions from on-site natural gas consumption increased by 20 percent and emissions from
transportation increased by 2 percent.
Differences in methodologies and data sources make direct comparisons between past CMAP GHG
emissions inventories and the 2020 Chicago MSA inventory difficult, though analysis of both datasets
suggests that 2010-2019 trends remain largely unchanged. Setting aside sectors not included in the 2019
inventory (agriculture, industrial processes, and sequestration), the CMAP region generated 109.5
MMTCO2e in 2020, which is comparable to the 113.1 MMTCO2e17 reported in the 2019 inventory.

NIRPC conducted its first GHG emissions inventory in 2017. The inventory covered all three counties
within NIRPC’s jurisdiction; however, only two of those counties, Lake and Porter, are in the Chicago
MSA. The 2017 NIRPC inventory relied on consumption data provided by local utilities, rather than the
U.S. EPA data used in the 2020 Chicago MSA inventory. The 2017 NIRPC inventory also included different

inventory (112.35 MMTCO2e). This is due to the addition of emissions data from two municipal electric utilities in
Kane County after publication.

sectors than the 2020 Chicago MSA inventory; agriculture and sequestration were omitted, but
importantly, industrial processes were included.
Because the 2017 NIRPC inventory did not provide county level data and was conducted for a geography
that does not fully align with the 2020 inventory, assessing trends is difficult. There are, nonetheless,
several findings that are instructive to emissions planning. Most notably, the 2017 NIRPC inventory
found that industrial processes and energy use (including fugitive emissions) accounted for 80 percent
of all GHG emissions in the region, which is comparable to the 2020 Chicago MSA inventory estimates
for Lake (IN) and Porter counties.

3 GHG Emissions Projections
Emissions Projections for the entire Chicago MSA based on the 2020 GHG Inventory and analysis of
available mitigation strategies will be done for the CCAP. This was not done for this PCAP.
However, the 2021 Climate Action Plan for the Chicago Region projected emissions based on the 2015
GHG inventory that was done for the 7-county Chicago metropolitan region only. These are presented
here as the best projections currently available. These wedge graphs also provide helpful visualizations
of the influence of different sectors in reducing GHG emissions.
The projections are organized by each of the 8 mitigation objectives that encompass all strategies that
follow in the Complete List of GHG Reduction Strategies in Section 6.

Wedge graphs that illustrate the relative impact of each GHG Reduction Objective are also presented on
respective pages of the Priority GHG Reduction Strategies (Section 5) for visualization purposes.

4 GHG Reduction Targets
GHG Reduction targets have not been set for the entire Chicago MSA inclusive of all sectors covered by
the 2020 GHG inventory. This critical task will be done with stakeholder engagement for the CCAP.
However, the 2021 Climate Action Plan for the Chicago Region set mitigation goals and objectives based
on the 2015 GHG inventory that was done for the 7-county Chicago metropolitan region only. Sciencebased targets were set following robust stakeholder feedback from within the Chicago metro region.
Objectives presented are foundational and the goals are representative to support understanding of the
Priority GHG Reduction Strategies and Additional Strategies.

Objective
All GHG Reduction Strategies
Priority GHG Reduction Strategies
Sample Quantified Measures
On the following pages are Priority GHG Reduction Strategies for the Chicago MSA with associated,
quantified measures. These measures are used to define a scale, rate, and implementation approach
that quantify the GHG reduction potential for each of these strategies. Multiple measures have been
quantified for some strategies demonstrating broad opportunities to implement that Priority Strategy.
Many of these quantified measures specifically support championed projects that are likely to be
submitted for CPRG Implementation funding consideration. This is true of the measures used to
illustrate GHG reduction potential for Strategies W1 and DT 15 which quantify achievable results within
the 5-year period of the CPRG Implementation timeline. Other measures illustrate more aspirational
results like the measures used to quantify Strategies DE2 and VMT11. The quantified measures should
not be perceived as restrictive approaches to implementing these strategies. Eligible applicants for
CPRG Implementation funding may propose any suitable project that addresses any of the
overarching Priority GHG Reduction Strategies, per CPRG Implementation General Competition
guidelines.

*Note that the Chicago MSA PCAP uses the term “strategy” as the enabling group of actions eligible for
CPRG funding and the term “measure” as a specific quantifiable example of actions that could be done
to implement that strategy. This was done to be consistent with the hierarchy of Goals, Objectives, and
Strategies used in the 2021 Climate Action Plan for the Chicago Region. The term “Priority GHG
Reduction Strategy” should be interpreted to mean “priority measure” in CPRG Implementation General
Competition guidance.
Detailed information about the methods used to quantify GHG reduction potential, scope of the and the
rationale for selecting these strategies, see Appendix A.

7 Low Income Disadvantaged Communities Benefits Analysis
This section addresses low-income and disadvantaged communities (LIDACs) in the Chicago MSA.
Identifying LIDACs is a critical first step to ensure that the communities that disproportionately face
climate, economic, and environmental burdens will receive needed benefits from PCAP implementation.
The LIDAC identification and mapping was completed by CMAP.

7.1.1 Identify Chicago MSA LIDACs
To identify low-income and disadvantaged areas in the Chicago MSA, CMAP used the Climate and
Economic Justice Screening Tool (CEJST) and the EPA’s Environmental Justice Screening and Mapping
Tool (EJScreen). These tools identify LIDACs by assessing indicators for categories of burden: air quality,
climate change, energy, environmental hazards, health, housing, legacy pollution, transportation, water
and wastewater, and workforce development. Following federal practice, CMAP identified any census
tract identified as disadvantaged in CEJST and/or any census block group that is at or above the 90 th
percentile compared to the nation and/or state for any of EJScreen’s supplemental indexes. Each of the
identified tracts and block groups that meet or exceed these thresholds is defined as a low-income and
disadvantaged community in the Chicago MSA.18 Additional details about the data resources used to
identify the low-income and disadvantaged communities are provided in Appendix D. Appendix E is the
complete list of LIDAC census blocks in the Chicago MSA with each census block group identified using
their U.S. Census Bureau block group identification number and includes their corresponding municipal
and county location(s). 19
Figure 1 maps the census block groups that meet this definition in the Chicago MSA. Overall, there are
2,881 census block groups identified as LIDACs in the Chicago MSA. Approximately 39 percent of the
total MSA population (3,677,911 of approximately 9.4 million total) lives in areas identified as low
income and disadvantaged communities. There are LIDAC block groups in each county, with 2,743,455
people living in LIDAC block groups identified in Cook County, Illinois alone. 20

18 CMAP used the U.S. EPA Inflation Reduction Act Disadvantaged Communities Map which combines CEJST and

EJScreen Supplemental Indexes into one footprint for relevant IRA programs and analyses. Available at:
https://www.epa.gov/environmentaljustice/inflation-reduction-act-disadvantaged-communities-map
19 Some census block groups span multiple municipal jurisdictions.
20 A note on Newton County, Indiana: Newton County contains only four, very large census tracts, with a low
population (the July 2022 estimate was 13,823). The four tracts are included as disadvantaged because of a mix of
CEJST’s housing, transportation, health, and workforce development burdens.

7.1.2 LIDAC Engagement in Climate Action Planning
The Metropolitan Mayors Caucus serves as a convening and coordinating council of governments for the
275 municipalities throughout northeastern Illinois. Caucus members include all municipalities in Cook,
DuPage, Kane, Kendall, Lake, McHenry and Will counties and the City of DeKalb in DeKalb County. This 7county+ service area encompasses 97% of the census tracts identified as LIDAC.
As such, the Caucus relied heavily on participation of its LIDAC member communities to provide
meaningful engagement in the PCAP process. Time constraints and administrative barriers related to
subawards for NIRPC prevented new, meaningful engagement of the remaining 4% of LIDACs, especially
in Indiana and Wisconsin and Grundy County in Illinois. More extensive meaningful engagement across
the MSA is planned for the duration of the CPRG planning process.
The Caucus’ representative leadership fosters a spirit of mutual trust and collaboration. The Executive
Board of the Caucus is comprised of mayors appointed by each of 9 sub-regional councils of
governments and the City of Chicago. These mayors, democratically elected by their constituents, are
then selected by their sub-regional council of governments (e.g. South Suburban Mayors and Managers
Association) to represent their sub-region on the Caucus Executive Board. Ten Executive Board
Members and Directors (55%) represent LIDAC communities including Batavia, Burr Ridge, Chicago,
Darien, Hazel Crest, Hillside, Northlake, Palos Hills, Richton Park, and University Park. The Executive
Board has been meaningfully engaged in the development of the Caucus’ 2021 Climate Action Plan for
the Region and the PCAP. This collaborative leadership body recognizes community values, concerns,
practices, and the local norms and history that LIDAC members are uniquely able to provide.
The Caucus further engages LIDAC communities within 7-county+ metro region through its Environment
Committee which is open to all Caucus member communities. The Environment Committee engaged in
the PCAP through discussion and facilitated participation (using the Mentimeter engagement tool) at
two Environment Committee meetings in May 2023 and January 2024. See Stakeholder Engagement
Section 1.3.3 above. All Caucus member municipalities were invited to the Climate Townhall in
December 2023 to provide input into the PCAP. NIRPC and CMAP extended invitations to additional
LIDAC communities and stakeholders beyond the Caucus’ reach.
The Metropolitan Mayors Caucus leads the Greenest Region Compact (GRC), the largest regional
sustainability collaborative for municipalities in the U.S. The GRC is a set of consensus sustainability
goals developed with consideration of the needs and capabilities of all municipalities in the Chicago
metro region. To date, 153+ municipalities and 5 counties have formally endorsed the goals of the GRC.
Of these, at least 61 are designated LIDAC. This broad consensus gives the Caucus the ability to
understand and address the needs and desired outcomes of LIDAC communities, relative to
sustainability and equitable climate action.
Finally, the 2021 Climate Action Plan for the Chicago Region (CAP) was crafted with input from 175
organizations. Fifty-three of those organizations were municipalities, and sixteen of those were
municipalities identified as LIDAC. Over the sixteen-month period (2019-2021) of CAP development
there were 20 meetings and events, which allowed for meaningful engagement of low income and
disadvantaged communities. See Appendix G. Robust community engagement by the City of Chicago in
the development of their 2022 Chicago Climate Action Plan also enriched our understanding of LIDAC
community priorities and needs.

56

Chicago MSA PCAP 3/1/2024

7.1.3 Estimate potential benefits of GHG emission reduction measures to LIDACs
Paired with each strategy of the Complete List of GHG Reduction Strategies is information relative to the
needs and opportunities for LIDAC. The “LIDAC Considerations” column notes planning and
implementation approaches that could maximize equitable benefits to LIDAC communities and minimize
disbenefits. The “Co-Benefits” column identifies benefits that could be realized by LIDAC from equitable
implementation of that strategy. Both LIDAC Considerations and Co-Benefits are paired with every
Priority GHG Reduction Strategy and Additional GHG Reduction Strategies. LIDAC benefits were key
decision factor for selecting Priority GHG Reduction Strategies.

7.1.4 LIDAC and Climate Impacts and Risks
A comprehensive climate risk and vulnerability assessment was done for the 2021 Climate Action Plan
for the Chicago Region.
This was undertaken in two comprehensive steps. First a set of climate known concerns were compiled
from literature reviews. See Appendix F.
Table 1. Vulnerability and risk scoping for the Chicago region based on literature review Climate-related hazards are ranked on
a scale of (1-5) indicating probability and potential consequences. The two are multiplied to assign a risk score.
Source: Buro Happold

This assessment considered risks and impacts to vulnerable populations. The tool used in the PCAP to
identify low income and disadvantaged communities (LIDAC) were not available in 2021 at the time of
CAP publication.
To complement climate science assessments, a live survey was done (on May 22, 2020) to gather
stakeholder perceptions about the probability and potential impacts from climate-related hazards.
Twenty-eight individuals including representatives from disadvantaged communities participated in this
ranking exercise.

8 Intersection with Other Funding Availability
The federal Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL) and the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) will make the largest
investment in climate action in U.S. history. Climate Pollution Reduction Grant Implementation funds
drive the development of this PCAP and spark innovative proposals to implement its strategies.
The IRA authorizes Direct Pay, a new way for non-profit and government entities to access federal
investment previously delivered only in the form of tax credits for businesses and individuals. At the
same time, the Illinois Climate and Equitable Jobs Act (CEJA) provides a pathway to a clean energy
future, and funding to begin the journey. CEJA enables Illinois utilities to invest in clean energy
technologies, grid resilience and electrification.
The dynamic nature of these new funding opportunities means that tracking and responding to them
can prove challenging for climate project planners. The PCAP organizes GHG Reduction Strategies
organized by Objectives. With the aim of accomplishing these objectives, this section provides an
overview of intersecting funding sources to complement CPRG investment.

8.1 Potential funding and resources
Objective 1: Demonstrate leadership to reduce emissions
As this mitigation objective focuses primarily on administrative and policy actions, many do not require
outside funding, but will require dedicated staff resources to implement. Technical assistance and
advisory support could facilitate implementation. The Illinois Sustainable Technology Center, affiliated
with the University of Illinois, manages a technical assistance program that focuses on operational
sustainability. CMAP and the Regional Transportation Authority (RTA) also maintain joint technical
assistance programs that provide consultant and in-house support for local and regional planning
projects, including grant readiness and capacity building projects. At the national level, the Local

58

Chicago MSA PCAP 3/1/2024

Infrastructure Hub provides municipalities with the resources and expert advice they need to access
federal infrastructure funding through programs such as grant application Bootcamps.
Academic and non-profit organizations such as the University of Illinois Extension and the Center for
Neighborhood Technology also offer extensive informational and educational resources that are
valuable for shaping conversations with residents, staff, and elected officials. Indiana University’s
Environmental Resilience Institute offers climate planning technical assistance to Indiana jurisdictions.
Objective 2: Decarbonize Energy Sources
The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) provides a number of funding sources to decarbonize energy
sources, including the Long-Duration Energy Storage Demonstrations Program, the Transmission
Facilitation Program, and Communities LEAP (Local Energy Action Program).
The U.S. Department of the Treasury offers a variety of tax credits intended to support the development
of clean energy projects, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) is available to support building
retrofits and energy projects in participating communities.
At the state level, the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency (IEPA) manages the Clean Energy
Innovation Fund, which can be used to fund “high-potential, early-stage Illinois-based cleantech
companies.” IEPA also administers the formula funding for the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Block
Grant in Illinois, which provides funding for energy planning projects. The Illinois Department of
Commerce and Economic Opportunity oversees several programs created through the Climate and
Equitable Jobs Act, including the Equitable Energy Future Grant program, which can be used for
renewable energy and energy efficiency projects primarily benefiting low-income communities.
Objective 3: Optimize Building Energy
Funding sources for building efficiency are substantially similar to those focused on decarbonizing
energy sources. The IEPA Energy Efficiency and Conservation Block Grant provides funding for building
decarbonization in addition to energy planning. The U.S. DOE Property Assessed Clean Energy Program
can also be used for both efficiency retrofits and on-site energy projects for residential and commercial
buildings. Of note, this program often requires enabling state legislation and authorization from local
governments.
The DOE offers several funding programs for building decarbonization such as Home Efficiency Rebates
and the Weatherization Assistance Program. The U.S. EPA and Department of Housing and Urban
Development (HUD) also offer a variety of funding programs to support building decarbonization
through retrofits, efficiency programs, and other investments, such as U.S. EPA’s Reducing Embodied
Greenhouse Gas Emissions for Construction Materials and Products grant and HUD’s Green and Resilient
Retrofit Program.
At the state level, several grant programs exist to fund building decarbonization, such as the Community
Development Block Grant Housing Rehabilitation Program at Illinois Department of Commerce and
Economic Opportunity, the Energy Efficiency Trust Fund Grant Program at IEPA, and Illinois Solar for All
through the state DOE. There are a variety of small-scale, local programs as well, but these are generally
programs designed to be applied for directly by residents and businesses to receive assistance from the
municipality for individual projects.

59

Chicago MSA PCAP 3/1/2024

In Illinois, ComEd offers a robust energy savings program that supports energy efficiency and beneficial
electrification goals established by CEJA. ComEd’s Smart Energy Marketplace offers a wide range of
incentives and services to help customers optimize building energy through energy efficiency and
electrification. Some of these services include free home energy assessments, rebates on energy
efficiency appliances, and discounts on efficient heating and cooling equipment. Public sector customers
may access facility assessments and rebates through ComEd’s Commercial and Industrial programs.
Dedicated funding and resources are available to help reduce household energy burden of income
qualified customers in LIDACs as well, including free energy-saving kits, weatherization improvements,
and the Whole Home Electric program for qualifying customers.
Objective 4: Implement Clean Energy Policies
Several of the measures included in this mitigation objective focus on administrative actions, such as
local and state policies, energy planning, and streamlining processes. These actions have lower
implementation costs but may benefit from technical assistance provided by CMAP, the Caucus, the
Interstate Renewable Energy Council (IREC), Slipstream, the Midwest Energy Efficiency Alliance (MEEA),
and other organizations.
In August of 2023, Elevate, the Illinois Green Alliance, and ComEd launched the Building Energy
Resource Hub to provide training and advisory services to building professionals. The Hub will support
building owners and developers in areas such as compliance with more efficient codes or taking on
building electrification.
The IRA provides up to $1 billion for states and units of local government with the authority to adopt
building energy codes to adopt and implement the latest building energy codes, zero energy building
codes, or equivalent codes or standards. Out of the $1 billion, there is $530 million available through the
U.S. DOE Assistance for the Adoption of the Latest and Zero Building Energy Codes funding opportunity.
Objective 5: Decarbonize Transportation
The federal government has various competitive funding opportunities to support the transition from
fossil fuels in the transportation sector. U.S. EPA manages a number of programs focused on freight
decarbonization, such as Clean Ports and Clean Heavy-Duty Vehicles. The U.S. Department of
Transportation (USDOT) offers funding programs targeting all aspects of the transportation sector
including the Low or No Emissions Grants for Buses and Bus Facilities Program, Port Infrastructure
Development Program and Infrastructure for Rebuilding America Grants, the Charging and Fueling
Infrastructure Discretionary Grant Program, and the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Program.
The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act also included funding for a wide range of transportation
areas discussed at length in the act’s guidebook.
Many federal funding programs are administered at a state, regional, and local level. Within the Chicago
metropolitan statistical area, CMAP, NIRPC, and SEWRPC are responsible for programming the
Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement Program, the Carbon Reduction Program, the
Transportation Alternatives Program, and the Surface Transportation Program within their respective
jurisdictions. Additional information about these programs is available on each agency’s website.
ComEd recently announced new EV rebates for residents, businesses, and public sector customers.
Residents can receive rebates for purchasing and installing at-home chargers, with the highest rebates
available for income-eligible customers. For businesses and public sector customers, ComEd is offering

60

Chicago MSA PCAP 3/1/2024

rebates for purchasing EVs and for installing make-ready infrastructure. Other rebates available for
vehicles include residential rebates on new or used EVs through Illinois’ CEJA and the Commercial Clean
Vehicle Credit for businesses and tax-exempt organizations that purchase EVs.
The Caucus supports municipalities and counties in the ComEd territory to become EV Ready
Communities through the EV Readiness Program. Working in cohorts, communities receive no-cost
technical assistance and work collaboratively to seek funding for EVs and EV charging infrastructure.
Objective 6: Reduce Vehicle Miles Traveled
Similar to the funding sources for decarbonizing transportation, this mitigation area has competitive
funding opportunities from several federal departments. U.S. DOT offers transit-related funding through
programs like the Low or No Emission Vehicle Program for buses and bus facilities and the TransitOriented Development Pilot Program. The U.S. Federal Transit Administration has the Integrated
Mobility Innovation Program and All Stations Accessibility Program, which aim to make transit a more
accessible, efficient, and innovative travel mode. The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act also
includes other funding opportunities for transit and are discussed at length in act’s guidebook.
Many of the federal transportation programs administered at the state, local, and regional level detailed
in the Decarbonize Transportation mitigation objective can also be used to support vehicle miles
traveled reduction efforts. These programs include Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement
Program, the Carbon Reduction Program, and the Transportation Alternatives Program. Motor fuel tax
funds may also be used to design and construct roadways that are safe and accessible for all road users,
allowing for alternatives to driving. In northeastern Illinois, CMAP and RTA’s joint technical assistance
program can also assist with these efforts.
The Active Transportation Alliance offers timely information and technical assistance to jurisdictions
seeking grant funding for active transportation projects.
Objective 7: Manage Water and Waste Sustainably
U.S. EPA maintains several funding sources for waste and wastewater projects, include Solid Waste
Infrastructure for Recycling Grants; Embodied Carbon in Construction Materials Grants, Technical
Assistance, and Labeling Program; and the Clean Water State Revolving Fund Program. USDA also
administers numerous relevant programs, including Composting and Food Waste Reduction Grants;
USDA Rural Utilities Service, Water, and Wastewater Loan/Grant Program; and the Solid Waste
Management Rural Development Grants. HUD Community Development Block Grants may also be used
for public facility construction and improvement projects such as water and sewer facilities.
At the state level, IEPA’s Public Water Infrastructure Plant Efficiency Program and Public Water Supply
Energy Efficiency Grant Program are great resources for water-focused projects. ComEd, Northeastern
Illinois’ primary electricity provider, also offers facility assessments for residential, commercial, and
public sector facilities.
Site scale green infrastructure projects that reduce the quantity of stormwater entering combined sewer
systems also play an important role in lowering emissions by reducing demand on wastewater
treatment facilities. Funding opportunities for these projects are discussed in the sustain ecosystems to
sequester carbon mitigation objective.

Objective 8: Sustain Ecosystems to Sequester Carbon
USDA offers many grants and funding programs to support green infrastructure, open space, and
ecosystem services under the umbrella of the Natural Resources Conservation Service, including the
Regional Conservation Partnership Program, the Conservation Stewardship Program, and Agriculture
Conservation Easement Programs.
At the state level, the Illinois Department of Natural Resources manages various grant programs such as
the Open Space Lands Acquisition and Development Program. At the local and regional level, several
private and non-profit organizations maintain funding and volunteer programs to support open space,
including USDA Urban Forestry Grants (administered by the Morton Arboretum), the Openlands
TreeKeepers Program and TreePlanters Grant, and the ComEd Green Region Grant. The Chicago Region
Tree Initiative maintains a helpful grants hub that tracks grants available for urban forestry and green
infrastructure projects as well. Local and county referenda for open space acquisition and maintenance
have historically provided the bulk of funding for open space preservation.

9 Next Steps
The work to prepare the Priority Climate Action Plan for the Chicago Metropolitan Statistical Area
heralds an exciting new era of broad collaboration to accelerate innovation, investment, and effective
climate action. Our hurried work towards these critical CPRG program deadlines has brought together
new partners across jurisdictions and state lines to think big and quickly aim for transformation. The
purpose of the PCAP is to prepare the Chicago MSA to propose big, transformative projects that will
implement our chosen Priority GHG Reduction Strategies. We are ready to work together to stem rising
greenhouse gas emissions causing global climate change.
The immediate next step is for these activated civic leaders to compile their project ideas into winning
proposals that will demonstrate the ability to significantly reduce GHG emissions, transform operations
and behaviors, reap benefits for low-income and disadvantaged communities, and contribute to the
equitable growth of our region. As a region, we hope for strong federal investment that capitalizes on
our local talent, Midwestern sensibility and imagination, and leverages our own local investment.
Following CPRG Implementation grant submissions, the Caucus, NIRPC and our constituents and
stakeholders will support CMAP is creating a robust Comprehensive Climate Action Plan for the Region
(CCAP) in June 2025. We will more earnestly seek to engage LIDAC communities and deepen our
climate commitments.
This Priority Climate Action Plan underscores the need for urgent coordinated action to equitably
mitigate climate change. Our regional culture of cohesion and collective expertise positions us well to
meet this challenge. All are invited to join us.

10 Appendix A: Priority GHG Reduction Strategy Quantification
Methodology
This section outlines the methodology used by CMAP, Cook County, ComEd, Lake Michigan Air Directors
Consortium, and others to calculate the greenhouse gas emission reduction potential of priority climate
action plan measures. The Objectives, Priority GHG Reduction Strategies, and Measures are listed below.
For each one, the measure and interim target year are identified.

10.1.1 Decarbonize Energy Source - DE2
Objective
Decarbonize Energy Sources

Priority GHG Reduction Strategy
Increase renewable energy supply and energy storage capacity
for residential, commercial, municipal, Institutional, and
industrial electricity use.

Measure 1: Generate 40 percent of electricity from renewable sources by 2030.
Quantifier: CMAP
Champion: Kane County
Estimated reduction: 23.11 MMT CO2e annually in 2030
Reference for establishing the measure: The State of Illinois adopted the Climate and Equitable Jobs Act
in 2021. The Act set a long-term target of achieving a carbon-free grid by 2045. The Act also called for
the state to generate 40 percent of its electricity from renewable (non-nuclear) sources by 2030 and 50
percent by 2040. The CEJA target is currently an Illinois target. This plan expands that target to include
portions of the MSA in Indiana and Wisconsin.
Calculation Method Description: The emissions and generation resource integrated database (eGRID) is
a comprehensive source of data from the EPA on the environmental characteristics of electric power
generation in the United States. The data includes emissions, emission rates, generation, resource mix,
and many other attributes that were useful in this policy analysis exercise. The entire Chicago MSA
region falls within the RFCW eGRID region.
For this analysis, the 2020 RFCW eGRID data were used to understand the CO2e reduction benefits,
compared to the baseline, of generating 40% of electricity for the entire MSA region from renewable
sources by 2030. To do this, the resource mix of the 2020 eGRID RFCW data would be updated to reflect
the 40% renewable electricity goal. 2030 electricity usage was also necessary for this analysis. The NREL
and DOE tool, SLOPE was used to get 2030 electricity usage, by county, for the entire MSA region. SLOPE
has energy usage projections for every county in the United States for all years through 2050. After
gathering 2030 electricity usage by county, these data were input into the EPA Local Greenhouse Gas
Inventory Tool. This tool allows a user to calculate electricity emissions based on existing eGRID rates or
based on custom rates. For the business-as-usual scenario, the 2030 Chicago MSA electricity usage data
was entered into this tool and emissions were calculated based on the 2020 eGRID resource mix. For the
40% renewable energy scenario, custom emission factors were calculated from eGRID rates based on
increases to Solar and Wind electricity generation to achieve the 2030 40% renewable energy goal. The
same 2030 Chicago MSA electricity usage data was entered into this tool and emissions were calculated
based on the 40% renewable energy goal resource mix. Table 1 provides the results of the analysis.

Measure 2: Increase on-site renewable energy by installing solar arrays at 20% of industrial
manufacturing, including metal and food and beverage manufacturing facilities.
Champion and Quantifier: Cook County
Estimated reduction: 0.057 MMT CO2e annually in 2030
Scope: Cook County
Calculation Method Description: Per ComEd energy efficiency assessment reports from 2023 at 2 food
and beverage manufacturers and 1 metal finisher site in Suburban Cook County, a single solar panel may
save .29 mt CO2e/yr. An average solar array on an industrial facility may save an average of 1,236,930
kWh/yr which is 864 mtco2e / yr. Per 2020 NEI data, there are 303 total food and beverage and metal
manufacturers in the Chicago MSA. 864 mtco2e extrapolated onto 20% of those sites (roughly 61
facilities). Due to limited data sample size and time constraints, this data should be used as a rough
sample size of industrial facilities capable of installing solar. ComEd Energy Efficiency Industrial
Assessment reports from 2023 - Suburban Cook County.

10.1.2 Optimize Building Energy - BE1
Objective

efficiency leveraging residential energy assessments, energy
efficiency rebates, incentives, tax credits and weatherization,
housing rehab, and energy assistance programs.

Measure 1: Assess residential homes for cost-effective energy efficiency measures, including
weatherization and building shell improvements, energy-efficient HVAC and appliances and other
measures.
Quantifier: ComEd
Estimated reduction: 0.41 MMTCO2e cumulative from 2024 to 2030
Scope: ComEd Territory

10.1.4 Optimize Building Energy - BE3
Objective

Optimize Building Energy

Priority GHG Reduction Strategy
Engage commercial, institutional, and industrial utility
customers to optimize building efficiency leveraging tools and
programs such as facility assessments, energy management,
retro commissioning, demand response, performance
contracting, energy efficiency rebates, incentives, tax credits ,
and PACE financing.

Measure: Replace 30% of fossil fuel boiler and process heating equipment/processes with electric,
hydrogen, or other non-GHG emitting based alternatives for all low and medium heat processes by 2030
Quantifier: CMAP
Champion: Cook County
Estimated reduction: 4.93 MMT CO2e annually in 2030
Scope: Chicago MSA
Measure Justification: Cook County identified this as a critical strategy to reduce industrial sector GHG
emissions.
Calculation Method Description: Electrification and hydrogen of low and medium heat processes were
measured in the Rocky Mountain Institute Energy Policy Simulator tool. This tool assesses a variety of
climate mitigation policies at the state level and calculates a reduction in million metric tons/year CO2e
emissions from the policies in question.
This 30% improvement rate by 2030 was applied to all industrial subsectors, with the exception of coal
mining, and for all three states within the Chicago MSA, which produced the reduction in MMT for all
three states. However, given that the Chicago MSA only encompasses portions of all three states, these
reductions needed to be scaled to only incorporate the areas within the MSA region.
To scale these state totals to the MSA, the total square feet of industrial building area was collected
using building data from Replica. Replica provides land use and building area data at the county level for
all counties within the country. This data was collected for Illinois, Wisconsin, and Indiana, as well as for

65

Chicago MSA PCAP 3/1/2024

the unique counties within the MSA in each of these respective states. These data were used to
calculate the proportion of industrial building area in each state that is represented within the Chicago
MSA, which acts as our scaling factor. Table 2 provides the scaled results.

Methodology (SO2, VOCs, NH3) to estimate the results of replacing sixteen (16) Tier-0 diesel locomotive
with battery-electric trainsets. Underlying assumptions are based on the diesel fuel consumption
averaged across Metra's fleet of various locomotive models given Metra's current scheduled service
runs annualized (195,780), which requires each locomotive to consume approximately 300,000 gallons
of Ultra-Low Sulfur Diesel (ULSD) fuel. The basis of the emissions reduction estimate is the sixteen (16)
retired locomotives reduce Metra’s annual ULSD consumption by 4,800,000 gallons, however, the
emissions produced to generate electricity to repower the battery-electric trainsets are not accounted
for due to the lack of known inputs at this time. Table 8

10.1.8 Decarbonize Transportation - DT9
Objective

Priority GHG Reduction Strategy

Decarbonize
Transportation

Transition medium and heavy duty freight vehicles and non road equipment to low
and zero-emission equipment and invest in distribution, make-ready and clean
fueling infrastructure

Measure 1: Support electrification or fuel-switching of 2.5% medium- and heavy-duty vehicles by 2030
Estimated reduction: 0.12 MMT CO2e annually in 2030
Quantifier: CMAP
Champion: Drive Clean Indiana
Scope: Entire MSA
Measure Justification: The United States is a signatory to the global Memorandum of Understanding to
advance Zero-Emission Medium and Heavy-Duty Vehicles (ZE-MHDV), which seeks to ensure that 30
percent of new medium and heavy-duty trucks sold in 2030 are zero-emission vehicles. A CMAP analysis
of truck sales and lifecycles suggests that implementing the policies needed to achieve this target will
result in the conversion of 2.5 percent of the region's medium and heavy-duty trucks to zero-emissions
vehicles by 2030. The share of zero-emission vehicles is expected to increase at a much faster pace
beyond 2030, as older vehicles are retired.
Calculation Method Description: This calculation assumes that Heavy Duty truck activity stays flat from
2020 to 2030 within the Chicago MSA. The 2020 MSA GHG Inventory utilized emission data from the
National Emissions Inventory to identify on-road transportation emissions. NEI transportation data
identifies emissions by vehicle type. Medium and heavy truck emissions are identified by the SCC Level 3
variable. The three following classes were included in determining the current emissions from medium
and heavy truck activity within the Chicago MSA: Combination Long-haul Truck, Combination Short-haul
Truck, Single Unit Long-haul Truck. NEI reports emissions in MT of CO2e. These emissions were reduced
by 2.5% to account for the stated electrification goal for medium and heavy trucks, Table 9.

Measure 2: Electrify 2.5% of non-road freight vehicles, especially terminal trucks and material handlers
and install clean fueling infrastructure.
Estimated reduction: 0.0138 MMT CO2e annually in 2030.
Quantifier: CMAP and Drive Clean Indiana
Champion: Drive Clean Indiana
Scope: NIRPC region
Quantification Methodology: This calculation assumes that non road freight vehicles activity stays flat
from 2017 to 2030 within the NIRPC region. NIRPC conducted a mobile emissions inventory that
provides emissions rates for a variety of sources, including nonroad sources such as diesel terminal
trucks and material handling equipment. The 2017 NIRPC mobile emissions inventory concluded
nonroad equipment produced 0.55195 MMT of CO2e. If 2.5% of that equipment were electrified by
2030, this would result in a 0.14 MMT annual reduction of CO2e.

Transition gas-powered landscaping equipment to low and zero
emissions models.

Measure: Replace gas-powered lawn and garden equipment with zero emissions electric models at this
rate 5% of residential mowers; 2% of commercial mowers' and 20% of commercial hand-held equipment
(e.g. leaf blowers)
Estimated reduction: 0.04162 MMT COe annually in 2030.
Quantifier: Lake Michigan Air Director’s Consortium
Champion: Metropolitan Mayors Caucus
Scope: DuPage, Cook, Kane, Kendall, Lake, McHenry, and Will counties
Quantification Methodology: The calculation assumes the defaults inside the MOVES nonroad model.
We used 2020 based emissions to estimate the impact of these programs. LADCO also used emission
reduction reports conducted by RAMBOL for ozone planning that were helpful in setting these goals.
The MOVES results assumed that we would impact 5% of residential offroad equipment, 20% of
commercial handheld equipment, and 2% of commercial mowers and tractors. These changes should
result in a 4% reduction in overall lawn and garden or 37,753 tons of CO2 in the metropolitan area.

10.1.11

Reduce Vehicle Miles Traveled- VMT11

Objective

Priority GHG Reduction Strategy

Reduce Vehicle Miles
Traveled

Establish a regional network of mobility hubs and expand shared
micromobility and electric micromobility systems.

Measure: Replace 35 percent of low-milage SOV trips with electric and/or micromobility trips by 2030.
Quantifier: CMAP
Champion: City of Chicago
Estimated reduction: 0.22 MMT CO2e annually in 2030
Scope: Entire MSA
Measure Justification: The City of Chicago 2022 Climate Action Plan aims to increase shared micromobility trips 30% by 2030 and to enable residents to walk, bike, take transit, or use shared micromobility by 45% by 2040. Similarly, under Kane County aims, through their Climate Action and

76

Chicago MSA PCAP 3/1/2024

Implementation Plan, to decrease community wide Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT) by 5% by 2030 and
increase public transit commuter ridership from 2.24% to 6.5% by 2030. Additionally, the DOE notes
that, in 2021, over 50% of car trips in the U.S. were 3 miles or less (with over half of that percentage
being trips under 1 mile). Using this data and local knowledge, a low-milage SOV trip was defined as 2
miles or less.
Calculation Method Description: The CMAP Trip Based Model, which models transportation activity for
12 of the 14 counties within the Chicago MSA, was used to identify the percentage of single occupancy
vehicle (SOV) trips that are deemed as "short trips". Short trips were defined as SOV trips that were 2
miles or fewer. The existing short SOV trips served as the baseline scenario while a 35% reduction in
these trips was the scenario that was tested. The Bicycle and Pedestrian Improvements tool within the
CMAQ emissions calculator toolkit was used to quantify the emissions benefit of this shift. This tool uses
emissions rates based on a national scale run of the EPA MOVES model to calculate the emissions
benefits of mode shift scenarios. The analysis year (2030) and the daily passenger vehicle trips for both
the baseline and reduction scenarios, and the trip distance distributions were entered into the tool. The
trip distance distribution of the short trips being considered in this analysis were identified based on
results from the CMAP trip based model. Of trips that were 2 miles or fewer in the Chicago MSA region,
40.69% were under 1 mile and 59.31% were between 1 and 2 miles. After entering these inputs into the
CMAQ tool, it calculated the daily CO2e emissions benefits of shifting 35% of SOV trips to micromobility
or existing transit options by 2030. The final step in this analysis was to scale the results to include the
two counties within the Chicago MSA that are not represented within the CMAP Trip Based Model
(Newton, IN & Jasper, IN). NEI CO2e on-road emissions for passenger vehicles were used to scale the
results for these two counties, as shown in Table 10. Table 10. Mode shift GHG reduction measure
quantification.

12 Appendix C: Greenhouse Gas Inventory Methodology and
Documentation
This section documents the methodology used to develop the 2020 Chicago MSA greenhouse gas (GHG)
emissions inventory and the process and results of executing the QAPP. The Chicago MSA is defined as
nine counties in Illinois, Cook, DuPage, Kane, Kendall, Lake, McHenry, Will, DeKalb, and Grundy, four
counties in Indiana, Newton, Jasper, Porter, and Lake, and one county in Wisconsin, Kenosha County.
The EPA tool, Local Greenhouse Gas Inventory Tool (LGGIT), was used to produce emissions for this
inventory. For each sub-sector, this document describes the methodologies and data sources used to
develop the inventory estimates. Following the inventory methodology, the results from the QAPP
process are also provided.

Stationary-Energy and Electricity Data
Stationary Energy encompasses emissions from natural gas and electricity within residential, commercial
and institutional, and industrial buildings. The following steps will detail how the data was collected,
refined, and entered into the GHG inventory tool.
1. Step 1: Use the SLOPE Data Viewer, which contains nationwide electricity and natural gas
consumption data. These data are disaggregated by economic sector (residential, commercial, and
industrial).

84

Chicago MSA PCAP 3/1/2024

2. Step 2: Filter data for the Inventory analysis year, 2020.
3. Step 3: Filter the data to include only the counties listed below.

ii. IL – DeKalb
iii. IL – DuPage
iv. IL – Grundy
v. IL – Kane
vi. IL – Kendall
vii. IL – Lake
viii. IL – McHenry
ix. IL – Will
x. IN – Jasper
xi. IN – Lake
xii. IN – Newton
xiii. IN – Porter
xiv. WI – Kenosha
4. Step 4: Use the conversion factors listed below in Table 2 to convert SLOPE outputs in MMBtu to the
required unit for entry into the LGGIT inventory tool.
Table 2. Conversion factors to convert SLOPE energy outputs, which are reported in millions of British

5. Step 5: Emissions from natural gas were entered into the inventory tool under the Stationary-Entry
tab and can be found on the Stationary-Data tab. Data was entered into the LGGIT tool by county
and sector.
Transportation Data
Transportation data were collected using 2020 NEI data. Due to limitations of the LGGIT tool, the NEI
results were entered into the “Additional Emission Sources” tab instead of the mobile entry tab within
the tool. The transportation data includes the following subsectors: on-road transportation, non-road
transportation, locomotives, and commercial marine vessels.
a. Step 1: Access the 2020 NEI data retrieval tool website.
b. Step 2: Select the following criteria
i. States:
1. Illinois
2. Indiana
3. Wisconsin
ii. Counties:
1. IL – Cook

Step 3: Select GHG as pollutant. NEI GHG’s include Carbon Dioxide (CO2), Methane (CH4), and
Nitrous Oxide (N2O).
Step 4: Filter out non transportation emissions. Select the following EIS sectors:
i. Mobile – Commercial Marine Vessels
ii. Mobile – Locomotives
iii. Mobile – Non-Road Equipment – Diesel
iv. Mobile – Non-Road Equipment – Gasoline
v. Mobile – Non-Road Equipment – Other
vi. Mobile – On-Road Diesel Heavy Duty Vehicles
vii. Mobile – On-Road Diesel Light Duty Vehicles
viii. Mobile – On-Road non-Diesel Heavy Duty Vehicles
ix. Mobile – On-Road non-Diesel Light Duty Vehicles
Step 5: Export the selected data
Step 6: Convert NEI data to Metric Tons (MT) NEI provides emissions in short tons so they need to
be converted to Metric Tons using the following conversion factor -- 0.907185 MT/1 short ton.
Step 7: Convert NEI data to CO2e. NEI emissions are reported for three GHG pollutants, CO2, CH4,
and N2O, see Table 3.

h. Step 8: Separate NEI data into sectors
i. Step 9: Input data into Additional Emission Sources tab.

Solid Waste Data
a. Step 1: Create a comprehensive list of landfills within the Chicago MSA region using the US EPA
FLIGHT tool. This tool provides emissions in CO2e, however, these values were converted using the

86

Chicago MSA PCAP 3/1/2024

global warming potential values The following filters were applied to the tool to identify landfills
within the MSA region
i. Data Year: 2020
ii. Browse to a State: Illinois
iii. Pick a Metro Area: Chicago-Naperville-Elgin, IL-IN-WI
1. This will include all landfills within the MSA region, not just those within Illinois.
iv. Sector: Waste (deselect Wastewater Treatment)
b. Step 2: Data was exported: describe process of selecting landfills within the Chicago MSA region.
c. Step 3: Each landfill report was examined to determine Methane, CO2, and NO2 emissions. These
data are reported in CO2e and are converted using GWP 4 rates within the FLIGHT tool. GWP values
provide a conversion rate to translate different pollutants into a standard CO2e value. Because the
inventory being described used GWP 5 rates, these values all needed to be converted back to raw
emissions using the GWP 4 rates and then converted back to CO2e using the GWP 5 rates. These
rates are shown in the table below.

d. Step 4: Converted FLIGHT raw emissions to CO2e emissions using GWP V5 values.
e. Step 5: Landfills were summarized by the county they were located in and were entered into the
spreadsheet tool in the solid waste entry tab.
Wastewater Data
a. Step 1: Wastewater emissions were estimated based on results from the CMAP 2019 GHG
Inventory. This inventory, which contains seven of the fourteen counties within the Chicago MSA
region, calculated wastewater emissions based on biogas consumption emissions at the wastewater
treatment plants in the region, as provided directly by the Metropolitan Water Reclamation District
(MWRD) wastewater treatment plants in the region. Electricity and natural gas usage from these
plants were included within the stationary energy sections of the inventory.
b. Step 2: MWRD provided CH4 and N2O emissions data. For counties included in both the Chicago
MSA Inventory and the CMAP 2019 Inventory, the rates from the 2019 CMAP inventory were kept.
For counties not included in the CMAP 2019 inventory, the data from MWRD was used to calculate
emissions per million gallons of wastewater treated per person for the CMAP region. These CMAP
per population rates were then used to calculate wastewater emissions from biogas emissions for
the counties not included in the CMAP 2019 inventory.
c. Step 3: Wastewater data was converted to MT C02e and were entered into the spreadsheet tool
under Additional Emission Sources.

Agriculture and Land Management Data
a. Step 1: Obtain state-level fertilizer data from the State Inventory Tool Agriculture Module. Fertilizers
consumption data at the state level is available from the State Inventory Tool (SIT) Agriculture
Module. The SIT Modules can be downloaded here. This dataset lists total nitrogen consumption in
metric tons by state on the FertilzerData tab.
b. Step 2: Fertilizer data is reported in fertilizer years, so we need to convert this to calendar years. The
Tennessee Valley Authority estimates that 35% of fertilizer consumption occurs from July to
December and 65% from January to June. However, values for the two years using the calendar year
of 2020 and 2019 are the same, so this does not impact the analysis.
i. Fertilizertotal = (Year 1 Fertilizer tm * 35%) + (Year 2 Fertilizer tm * 65%)
ii. Where:
1. Fertilizertotal: total amount of fertilizer applied during the calendar year
2. Year 1 Fertilizer tm: total amount of fertilizer applied during Year 1 fertilizer year
3. Year 2 Fertilizer tm: total amount of fertilizer applied during Year 2 fertilizer year
4. tm: metric tons
iii. Illinois: 937,962 = (937,962 * 35%) + (937,962 * 65%)
iv. Indiana: 460,067 = (460,067 * 35%) + (460,067 * 65%)
v. Wisconsin: 321,396 = (321,396 * 35%) + (321,396 * 65%)
c. Step 3: Convert from metric tons to short tons to enter into the Community Greenhouse Gas Tool.
i. Fertilizertotal = Fertilizer tm / 0.9072
ii. Where:
1. Fertilizertotal: total amount of fertilizer applied, from all sources
2. ts: short tons
3. tm: metric tons
4. 0.9072: the conversion factor for metric tons to short tons
iii. Illinois: 1,033,909 ts = 937,962 tm / 0.9072
iv. Indiana: 507,128 ts = 460,067 tm / 0.9072
v. Wisconsin: 354,273 ts = 321,396 tm / 0.9072
d. Step 4: Calculate the consumption of each fertilizer type. So far, we have established statewide
fertilizer usage across all types of fertilizers. The following formulas will calculate the consumption
of synthetic fertilizer, manure, and organic fertilizer.
i. Calculating Consumption of Fertilizer, Synthetic N (short tons)
1. Fertilizersynthetic = Fertilzer ts * 99.75%
2. Where:
a. Fertilizersynthetic : amount of synthetic fertilizer applied, from total fertilizer (short
tons).
b. 99.91%: percentage of synthetic nitrogen fertilizer in total fertilizer.
3. Illinois: 1,031,357 = 1,033,909 * 99.75%
4. Indiana: 505,876 = 507,128 * 99.75%
5. Wisconsin: 353,398 = 354,273 * 99.75%
ii. Calculating Consumption of Fertilizer, Manure (short tons)
1. Fertilizermanure = Fertilizer ts * 0.01%
2. Where:
c. Fertilizer manure: amount of manure applied, from total fertilizer.
d. 0.01%: Percentage dried manure fertilizer in total fertilizer.
3. Illinois: 60 = 1,033,909 * 0.01%

88

Chicago MSA PCAP 3/1/2024

4. Indiana: 30 = 507,128 * 0.01%
5. Wisconsin: 21 = 354,273 * 0.01%
iii. Calculating Consumption of Fertilizer, Activated Sewage Sludge (short tons)
1. Fertilizerorganic = Fertilizer ts * 0.15%
2. Where:
e. Fertilizerorganic: amount of activated sewage sludge fertilizer applied, from total
fertilizer
f. 0.05% : percentage of (organic) sewage sludge in fertilizer
3. Illinois: 1,603 = 1,033,909 * 0.15%
4. Indiana: 786 = 507,128 * 0.15%
5. Wisconsin: 549 = 354,273 * 0.15%
iv. Calculating Consumption of Fertilizer, Other Organic Materials (short tons)
1. Fertilizerother = Fertilizer ts * 0.09%
2. Where:
g. Fertilizerother: amount of other fertilizer applied (e.g., compost), from total
fertilizer.
h. 0.09% : percentage of other fertilizer
3. Illinois: 889 = 1,033,909 * 0.09%
4. Indiana: 436 = 507,128 * 0.09%
5. Wisconsin: 305 = 354,273 * 0.09%
e. Step 5: Downscale state-level data to the county level. After state-level data are calculated, it
needs to be downscaled to the county level. To do this, state-level fertilizer consumption estimates
were multiplied by the proportion of state cropland acreage found within each of the counties in the
Chicago MSA region. Total cropland acres in each county and state can be downloaded from the U.S.
Department of Agriculture (USDA)’s QuickStats database.
i. Scaling State-Level Fertilizer Data to the County Level
1. Fertilizercounty = (Cropland acrescounty / Cropland acresstate) * Fertilizerstate
2. Where:
a. Cropland acrescounty: total cropland acreage per selected county, from USDA
QuickStats
b. Cropland acresstate: total cropland acreage per selected state, from USDA
QuickStats
c. Fertilizerstate fertilizer type: total fertilizer consumption per fertilizer type (synthetic,
organic, manure) per selected state, from SIT Agriculture Module.

Step 6: Enter fertilizer consumption data into the tool.

Industrial Processes
a. Step 1: Industrial process emissions are reported to the EPA and are available for download via the
GHG reporting program. There are two relevant reports that needed to be downloaded, the sector
information and the subpart summary information. The sector information report provides
greenhouse gas information displayed by reporting sectors. The Subpart information report provides
greenhouse gas information displayed by the subpart that a facility reports under.
b. Step 2: Subpart Information Summary
i. Choose a Subject Area: Subpart Information

d. Step 3: Review both downloaded files and filter out data for counties that are not included in the
Chicago MSA region.
e. Step 4: A sector mapping crosswalk was developed for the 2019 CMAP GHG Inventory and this
resource was utilized for this inventory. The crosswalk can be found on the CMAP_Sector_Lookup
tab of the Chicago_MSA_GHGRP_Data.xlsx.
i. Due to the larger geography of this inventory, several subsectors were not included within
the crosswalk. These were added to the existing CMAP Sector Mapping crosswalk and are
now included on the CMAP_Sector_Lookup tab.
f. Step 5: Emissions were summarized by County for the following sectors
i. Power Plant Emissions
ii. Natural Gas Refineries
iii. Petroleum Refining
iv. Petroleum and Natural Gas Systems
v. Hydrogen Production
vi. Ethanol Production
vii. Iron and Steel Production
viii. Petrochemical Production
ix. Lime Production

g. Step 6: Emissions were entered into the GHG Inventory tool in CO2e
Carbon Sinks
a. Step 1: Carbon sinks are represented by tree coverage within this inventory. Tree coverage data
comes from the U.S. Department of Agriculture tool, i-Tree. I-Tree is a peer reviewed database that
provides urban and rural forestry analysis and benefits assessment tools. The first step was to obtain
county level tree canopy coverage from i-tree tools. The counties selected are listed below:

b. Step 2: The next three steps do not require any additional user action. The final step within the tool
will generate a report. Users should select the following criteria to produce a report with tree
canopy coverage by counties:
a. Report Type: Executive Summary
b. Report Element: Canopy and Impervious
c. The following report, showing tree canopy coverage by county, is the result.
i. http://landscape.itreetools.org/report/48a4e664-dcca-4f63-a18639e321b144c6/executive-summary
c. Step 4: Obtain land use data by County from Replica. This land use dataset provides area in square
feet for fifteen distinct land use categories. This inventory only considers residential,
commercial/institutional, industrial, and energy generation as categories, so each of the land use
categories needed to be assigned to one of these four categories. Table 6 provides the crosswalk
that was used.

12.1.3 Quality Assurance Project Plan Process and Results
As required, CMAP developed a Quality Assurance Project Plan (QAPP) that outlined the process for
reviewing the development of the GHG inventory for quality assurance purposes. The following section
outlines the process for performing the QAPP and provides the results by sector/emission source.
Mobile Sources
As described above, mobile sources in this inventory were collected from the U.S. National Emissions
Inventory. This dataset is considered of the highest quality rank in terms of data quality. The
methodology used to gather this data and enter it into the inventory tool also followed EPA guidance.
Data was collected twice, once when it was entered into the inventory tool and then a second time,
following the instructions noted in the mobile sources section above, to ensure that no errors were
made in collecting, cleaning, and entering the data into the inventory tool. This analysis resulted in an
exact match to the inventory entry.
Mobile emissions were also compared to the 2019 CMAP Greenhouse Gas Inventory and a variance
between the two inventories for the overlapping areas, Table 8. Only the seven MSA counties covered
within the CMAP 2019 GHG Inventory were compared.

All these subsectors were within the stated variance within the MSA QAPP. It is important to note that
there while all three of these subsectors fall within the stated variance goals within the MSA QAPP,
emissions from locomotives and marine vessels are larger than other comparisons. This is primarily tied
to additional emissions from marine vessels within the CMAP 2019 GHG Inventory. These differences
should be noted and considered for future analysis.
Electric Power Consumption
As described above, electric power consumption in this inventory were derived from the EPA tool
SLOPE, which provides power consumption estimates by county. Data for this section were collected
twice, once when it was entered into the inventory tool and then a second time, following the
instructions noted in the stationary energy section above, to ensure that no errors were made in
collecting, cleaning, and entering the data into the inventory tool. This analysis resulted in an exact
match to the inventory entry.
Electricity consumption emissions were compared to the 2019 CMAP Greenhouse Gas Inventory and a
variance between the two inventories for the overlapping areas, Table 9. Only the seven MSA counties
covered within the CMAP 2019 GHG Inventory were compared.

Both the fugitive emissions and energy industry subsectors were within the stated variance within the
MSA QAPP. It is important to note that there while all three of these subsectors fall within the stated
variance goals within the MSA QAPP, there are still significant differences between the two inventories,
despite similar sources and methodologies. Specific facilities were examined and compared as part of
the QA process to determine if specific plants were responsible for the increase in emissions from the
CMAP 2019 inventory to the 2020 MSA inventory. Several facilities, such as the Lemont Refinery in Will
County, Illinois were identified as having significantly higher emissions in 2020 than 2019, as reported to
the GHGRP.
Emissions from other industrial processes, such as metal and glass production were not included in the
2019 CMAP GHG Inventory and thus, cannot be used for QC. These emissions were compared to the

The Climate and Economic Justice Screening Tool (CEJST)
CEJST is an interactive map that identifies disadvantaged communities at the Census tract level based on
indicators of burdens in eight categories: climate change, energy, health, housing, legacy pollution,
transportation, water and wastewater, and workforce development.24 To qualify as disadvantaged, one
of the burden indicators must exceed the 90th percentile. Developed by the Council on Environmental
Quality in response to Executive Order 14008: Tackling the Climate Crisis at Home and Abroad, 25 the tool
is intended to be used for federal programs covered by the Justice40 Initiative. Justice40 seeks to deliver
40 percent of the benefits of investments in climate, clean energy, and related areas to disadvantaged
communities.

EJScreen is U.S. EPA’s environmental justice mapping and screening tool. The 13 supplemental indexes
combine environmental indicators with demographic socioeconomic indicators, to show how an area
compares to the state, EPA region, or nation in terms of environmental justice. The five-factor
supplemental demographic index averages the following factors: percent low-income, percent
unemployed, percent limited English speaking, percent less than high school education, and low life
expectancy.27 The purpose of this methodology is to display areas with the highest intersection between
socioeconomic factors and the given environmental indicator.
26

Why use both tools to identify low-income and disadvantaged communities?
EJScreen operates at the census block group level, which is at a finer geographic scale than CEJST, which
operates at the census tract level (census tracts, which are typically subdivisions of counties, contain
block groups, which are groups of blocks within tracts).28 EJScreen ensures that smaller areas (especially
those within non-disadvantaged areas) can still be identified as disadvantaged. Generally, EJScreen’s
supplemental indexes provide a focused view of environmental justice across communities, while CEJST
provides a broader view of burdens relevant to climate and economic justice. In tandem, they can guide
implementation of PCAP measures that will deliver key co-benefits that address climate, economic, and
environmental impacts in overly burdened communities. 29
Identifying LICADs
An initial review of the screening criteria shows that only the first 7 of the 13 EJScreen supplemental
indexes are likely to impacted by the PCAP’s greenhouse gas emissions reduction measures (Table
1).CMAP conducted an additional review of block groups that are only identified as disadvantaged based
on the remaining EJScreen supplemental indexes (8-13).30 This additional analysis indicated that only a
small percentage of the overall LIDACs were identified via these indexes alone. CMAP concluded that
using all the EJScreen supplemental indexes in the LIDAC definition would help identify the greatest
number of communities most in need of investment.

27 The 13 Supplemental Indexes differ from the Environmental Justice Index in that the Supplemental Indexes use a
five-factor demographic index, as opposed to the two-factor demographic index used by the Environmental Justice
Index (which only averages low income and people of color populations). The five-factor demographic index
provides a more comprehensive picture of the characteristics and vulnerabilities of a community.

30 Only 69 census block groups were identified by EJScreen Supplemental Indexes 8-13 alone, compared to the
nearly 3,000 census block groups identified via CEJST and EJ Screen Supplemental Indexes 1-7.

Further refinements to the LIDAC definition will be explored through the development of the
Comprehensive Climate Action Plan to ensure adequate representation of regional burdens and needs.
While well established and highly vetted, CEJST and EJScreen were developed at the federal level and
operate at the national scale. CMAP sees an opportunity to both explore a more regionally focused
approach and to develop a stronger and more granular understanding of the burdens that communities
face across the region during the Comprehensive Climate Action Plan process. Doing so could inform
effective greenhouse gas emissions reduction strategy development and implementation at a more
granular level. As such, the enclosed LIDAC definition and identified LIDACs should be understood to be
provisional for the purposes of the PCAP but may be updated in the future to better reflect the
characteristics and needs of the region.

Heat waves have caused illnesses, hospitalizations, and deaths in vulnerable communities [1]
The Chicago region experienced a historic heat wave in 1995 that led to 700 heat-related deaths, followed by another heat wave in 1999 with more than 100 deaths. The 1995 heat wave resulted in major
reforms to Chicago’s emergency response programs: The city formed a Commission on Extreme Weather Conditions, developed a comprehensive Extreme Weather Operations Plan, and established better
coordination among emergency responders call centers, and traffic management. [1]

The aquifer that provides water for many parts of northwest Will County and the eastern portion of Kane County could be completely depleted in 2050 -- and aquifers that supply water to areas in Kane
County, southeast Kendall County, and northern Kendall County could be at least partially desaturated.20 With limited access to Lake Michigan for drinking water, 21 communities who are dependent
upon already stressed groundwater supplies could face growing water supply issues during periods of drought. Municipalities may need to switch water sources and build new wells and treatment plants,
which could increase the costs of water. Furthermore, because groundwater feeds into multiple water bodies, withdrawals from shallow aquifers would also negatively impact the ecosystems of streams,
lakes, wetlands, and Lake Michigan. [4]

In areas along rivers and streams, floodplains would flood more frequently. Drainage systems in built-out parts of the region would often be overwhelmed, causing more basement backups and ponding
in yards and parks, while impairing access on roads. By mid-century, federal and state governments, residents, businesses, and municipalities will likely be paying significantly more to address property
damage and accidents caused by flooding and rain. Private insurers may also choose to exclude flood prone areas, particularly where stormwater infrastructure has not been upgraded, from coverage,
leading to greater dependence on federal programs. [4]
