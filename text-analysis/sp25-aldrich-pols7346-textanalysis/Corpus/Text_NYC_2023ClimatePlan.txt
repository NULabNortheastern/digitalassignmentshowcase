To my fellow New Yorkers:
From torrential rainstorms to viciously high tides to sweltering temperatures,
New Yorkers are feeling the brutal effects of climate change. The results are
devastating and all too often tragic. They have the worst impact on our most
vulnerable communities. And they demand action.
Action is what PlaNYC: Getting Sustainability Done is all about. This is the
Get Stuff Done PlaNYC
.
PlaNYC: Getting Sustainability Done is an action plan for a cleaner, greener,
and more just city for all as we reckon with decades of economic and
environmental injustice.
The GSD PlaNYC is for the senior citizen whose health depends on being
able to afford an air conditioner and the monthly utility bill that makes
cooling possible, and for the high school graduate who wants to secure
their future by mastering an emerging green trade, so they can move from
a low-wage job to a career in an in-demand job market. We will bring relief
to those who live in flood-prone zones and high-pollution neighborhoods.
Fundamentally, PlaNYC: Getting Sustainability Done is about protecting New
York City and making it more livable and vibrant for today’s New Yorkers
and future generations.
Over the past two decades, we have taken remarkable steps to make our
city more sustainable, resilient, and equitable. Thanks to this team and the
leadership of my predecessors, New York City has led the way on urban
climate solutions. We’ve invested tens of billions of dollars in resilience
projects; enacted Local Law 97 to reduce emissions from large, private
buildings; and created nearly 1,000 miles of bike lanes. We’ve established
ambitious goals to prepare our city for the future. Today, we are making
a commitment to New Yorkers to deliver on them.
PlaNYC: Getting Sustainability Done will produce results that New Yorkers will
feel all year long, in blue skies and gray skies alike. This plan will help ensure
that every New Yorker is protected from climate threats, has an improved
quality of life, and can take advantage of some of the more than 230,000
green economy jobs that this city will host by 2030.
We will reduce carbon emissions from our transportation network and
building stock, bolster our waterfront infrastructure, and ramp up our
transformation to a circular economy. And we will reduce air pollution and
clean our waterways; increase the availability of healthy food; and protect
New Yorkers from higher temperatures, extreme rainfall and coastal flooding.
The urgent threat that climate change poses to our communities demands
a similarly urgent response. It compels us to get sustainability done, because
billions of dollars — and millions of lives — are at stake. We will bring an
all-of-government effort to bear against this threat, and we will deliver the
solutions that New Yorkers have been promised and deserve.

Introduction
A LIVABLE CITY for Every New Yorker
7
Climate change has shifted from a threat
on the horizon to a recurring aspect of our
lives with impacts felt disproportionately
in vulnerable communities, leading to
hundreds of preventable deaths every year.
At the same time, the benefits of climate
action are increasingly clear in growing
green jobs and businesses, cleaner
air, better mobility, and safer homes.
Responding to and preparing for climate
change means improvements to our
daily lives today and a future that is more
equitable, healthy, and resilient.
Domino Park was constructed as part
of the ongoing redevelopment of the
Domino Sugar Refinery site in Williamsburg,
Brooklyn. The park attracts pedestrians
and cyclists for its diverse plantings and
sweeping views of the East River, among
other recreational opportunities.

The City of New York has spent
the past decade and a half setting
ambitious climate targets and
groundbreaking policies, yet
tremendous work remains to achieve
our goals and secure the future
of our city and our world. With our
population density, economy, and
consumption rate, we have a unique
opportunity to be a global leader in
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions
reduction. Further, as a leading global
city, we must do our part not only to
reduce our emissions and protect
New Yorkers, but also to protect
the future of our planet. PlaNYC is
centered in delivering climate justice
through bold, swift action to reduce
our contributions to climate change
and protect New Yorkers—especially
the most vulnerable among us—from
impacts we are already experiencing.
PlaNYC: Getting Sustainability Done is
the fifth in a series of climate action
plans released by New York City,
pursuant to Local Law 84 of 2013.1
Like previous plans, it is the result of
The first PlaNYC in 2007 was
an assertion by the Bloomberg
Administration that New York City had
both the need and the power to plan
for long-term growth.2 Following the
decline of the 1970s, along with the
more recent September 11th attacks,
that both left the future of the city
in question, this commitment to the
long-term planning and investment
was a bold statement with an outlook
to a prosperous future. The City
also recognized that it was critical
to address long-range challenges,
including climate change, which was
and is an existential threat to the
future of our city. At the time, there
was resistance to climate action and a
general sense that climate adaptation
was not an urgent need. Nonetheless,
PlaNYC established much of our
current climate infrastructure,
including an annual GHG inventory;
the requirement of a regularly updated
sustainability plan incorporated by
Local Law 17 in 2008; and the New
York City Panel on Climate Change
(NPCC) scientific advisory body.3 The
plan also charted new paths forward,
making energy-efficiency mandates
for existing buildings a priority and
encouraging a shift away from cars
toward walking and cycling.
Under the de Blasio administration,
PlaNYC’s scope dramatically
expanded under the title of OneNYC,
a result of three changes.4 The first
was to expand beyond sustainability
to include resilience. Climate change
had become more real to New
Yorkers in the wake of Hurricane
Sandy’s devastation in October 2012,
shifting resilience from a long-term
contingency to a near-term priority.
The second was a focus on equity,
which was integrated into all aspects
of sustainability policy. The third was
expanding the sustainability plan to a
strategic plan for the entirety of City
government. OneNYC 2050 included
long-term targets for the City’s climate
efforts.5 These included goals for
building decarbonization codified in
Local Law 97 of 2019, the 2021 ban
on gas hookups in new buildings, the
establishment of commercial waste
zones, and Executive Order No.
99, which created a framework to
decarbonize City operations.
Building on the equity focus of the last
plan, this plan centers environmental
justice in all of our work, while
focusing on taking concrete actions
towards achieving our long-standing
climate goals. Focus is essential for
action and implementation, so this
plan targets sustainability broadly
defined as climate action, ambient air
quality, water quality, and open space.
deep interagency coordination and
the advice of the City’s Sustainability
Advisory Board. It also reflects the
leadership of Mayor Eric Adams and
the evolution of New York’s action on
climate change.

Introduction
laNYC: Getting Sustainability Done
BACKGROUND & APPROACH
PlaNYC: Getting Sustainability Done
builds on the prior four plans while
facing the challenges and seizing
the opportunities that are specific to
today. PlaNYC is grounded in a more
comprehensive understanding of
climate change impacts in the city as
well as a more complete picture of
our GHG footprint, including a new
consumption-based inventory. For
the first time, we have a complete
picture of our emissions both within
the city’s geography as well as the
full lifecycle emissions from the
food and products we consume as
New Yorkers. Lastly, this plan has a
greater focus on environmental justice
and public health. Despite overall
improvements in the city’s air quality,
environmental justice communities
continue to face increasingly negative
health outcomes related to air
pollution and climate hazards. At the
same time, these challenges present
opportunities to improve the city’s
environmental conditions and build
prosperity, equity, and community.
The following principles have
shaped this plan:
GUIDING
PRINCIPLES
In November 2021, Congress
passed the Bipartisan Infrastructure
Law, a once-in-a-generation $1.2
trillion investment in our nation’s
infrastructure that prioritizes
sustainability, resilience, and
equity over the next five years.6
The following year, the landmark
Inflation Reduction Act (IRA)
advanced clean energy policy by
designating almost $370 billion
for energy and climate change
investments.7
 The IRA is meant to
increase production of clean and
renewable energy sources, decrease
energy costs, and lower GHG
emissions. Most recently, at the State
level, the Clean Water, Clean Air and
Green Jobs Environmental Bond Act
authorized $4.2 billion for climate
change and environmental projects.8
Responding to these tremendous
investments, the City has formed
the NYC Federal Infrastructure
Funding Task Force to maximize
all the funding from these Federal
and State sources. The City’s task
force is helping to select strong
shovel-worthy and shovel-ready
projects that meet the guidelines
and standards of new and existing
competitive grant opportunities.
The City has received $305
million in competitive grant funds
since the beginning of the Adams
administration, and applied for
more than $1.3 billion in
competitive grant funding in 2022.9
As the breadth of opportunity
grows, so will the City’s efforts to
secure funds.
LEVERAGING FEDERAL AND STATE FUNDING
NYC Federal Infrastructure Funding Task Force 
Mayor Adams convened the
Capital Process Reform Task
Force in April 2022 to study ways
to reform capital project delivery,
reduce costs, and speed projects
to completion. In October 2022,
the task force released 17 initial
recommendations, followed
in early January 2023 by 22
additional recommendations. The
task force has four charges: to
reduce project timelines, reduce
costs, increase diversity and
inclusivity in the capital projects
process, and expand the City’s
capacity to address emergencies.11
We will implement the
recommendations from the Capital
Process Reform Task Force,
including working with the State
legislature on progressive designbuild authority. Many of the
1. Act with urgency and focus on
implementation
The policymaking and legislation of
the last 16 years has left a significant
amount of work on the table. In some
cases, this is by design, knowing that
projects can take decades; in other
cases, it is due to pandemic-related
delays or the unimagined complexity
of implementing groundbreaking
climate laws and policies. This plan
prioritizes implementation and getting
sustainability done.
2. Achieve near-term benefits for
New Yorkers while implementing
long-term goals
Due to their size and scale, many
climate and equity actions are longterm by nature. Yet the New Yorkers of
2023 cannot wait for local benefits
in job creation, protection from climate
risks, or air pollution reduction. This
plan prioritizes actions that have
near-term benefits.
3. Center environmental justice
and health equity in our work
A long history of environmental
burdens on low-income New Yorkers
and communities of color has led to
deep-seated health disparities that
are apparent in everyday lives of
some New Yorkers. This plan centers
environmental justice and health
equity in every action we take, with
an urgency to achieve near-term
health benefits for environmental
justice communities.
4. Create economic activity
through climate action
The investments we make today
for climate action have the ability
to contribute to the city’s overall
economic recovery and long-term
prosperity. Further, this is an
opportunity to create good jobs
for people of color in emerging
sectors—allowing for long-term
economic mobility.
5. Strengthen private sector
investments through both
incentives and mandates
Budget constraints have forced
us to think creatively about how
to fund climate action and what is
most critical to moving the needle
on our climate goals. This plan
features broad new policies that will
apply to both the public and private
sectors while highlighting where the
City is leading by example.
6. Lead by example as a City
The City aims to be a model for
other cities and nations and the
private sector, which is central to
New York’s economy. Further, while
the City sets ambitious policies
across the public and private
sectors, we recognize the need to
lead by charting new pathways and
testing new technologies.
7. Make full use of
unprecedented Federal and
State funding
Progress on our climate initiatives
requires collaboration and
investment from our Federal and
State partners. Since both the
United States and the State of
New York are spending significant
amounts of money on climate
action and equity, and NYC
contributes more to the Federal
and State governments than it
typically receives in return, it is
critical that we fully leverage these
new funding sources and obtain
our fair share. As a result, several
of the initiatives in this plan are
dependent on new and expanded
Federal and State grants. A
primary objective of the Adams
administration’s climate policy
will be to ensure that New York
State’s climate action gives
New York City residents and
businesses their fair share of all
types of funding and support.
8. Implement climate budgeting
to align City resources
with sustainability and
resilience goals
To ensure that we remain focused
on prioritizing climate change and
environmental justice in our
investments and decision-making,
New York City will be one of the
first global cities, and the first
major city in America, to launch
a Climate Budgeting initiative.
Climate budgeting is a process
that incorporates sciencebased climate considerations into
the City’s budget decision-making
process by evaluating how actions
and spending today contribute
to meeting longer-term climate
targets. The process will allow
us to understand the climate
impact of the dollars we spend,
identify where more investment is
needed, and champion forwardlooking investments. For example,
while switching buildings to
efficient electric heating may have
a higher cost than replacing fossil
fuel equipment today, electrification
reduces GHG emissions and
improves local air quality over its
lifetime. Similarly, although protecting
vulnerable communities from
heat waves will require significant
investments, taking these steps
will mitigate medical costs associated
with increasingly intense heat and
save lives.
9. Streamline the City’s
procurement processes to
expedite project delivery
Identifying process inefficiencies can
help the City become nimbler and
better able to deploy resources where
and when they are most needed.
In addition to the Capital Process
Reform Task Force recommendations,
Get Stuff Built: A Report of the
Building and Land Use Approval
Streamlining Task Force was released
in 2022 and identified 111 ways the
development process is broken,
accompanied by recommendations
for solutions that simplify and shorten
the review and approval of new
projects.10 By improving contracting
and procurement efficiency and the
way we implement public projects,
our City’s response to climate
change will be expedited. The City is
committed to improving contract and
procurement processes—including
looking at ways to undertake
the most efficient structures—to
implement our projects. When all
projects have a climate resilience
or sustainability component, all
projects are climate projects.
Expediting Project Delivery 
reforms already identified, such as
advocating in the State legislature
for design-build methodology,
are directly applicable to climate
projects. Likewise, increased
flexibility and contracting limits
for minority and women-owned
businesses will further diversify
the workforce and help ensure that
jobs and income related to City
capital expenditure are shared by
working New Yorkers.
In 2023, the task force will
continue implementing already
approved initiatives and advocating
to the State for needed legislative
reforms. Applying an “every
project is a climate project” lens
and an environmental justice
lens will support identification
of additional reforms and
implementation pathways.

GUIDING PRINCIPLES
Climate Budgeting is a paradigm
shift from status quo to holistic
decision-making that will ensure
we follow through on meeting
our ambitious climate goals.
The City oversees a multi-billion
dollar capital portfolio that shapes
our buildings, transportation,
recreational spaces, energy
supply, and infrastructure. Some
investments are made with the
specific intent to reduce emissions
or increase resilience. Other
programs and services, including
increasing affordable housing,
maintaining infrastructure in
good repair, and procuring
food for students, impact our
climate goals as well. For each
of our investments, we need
to understand: will they keep
us on course, steer us in the
wrong direction, or accelerate
our progress? Furthermore,
we need to understand the
collective impact of the City’s
policies and investments toward
achieving both our near- and
long-term targets.
The New York City Mayor’s
Office of Management and
Budget’s (OMB) newly
established Environmental
Sustainability & Resiliency Task
Force, a group that coordinates
and guides smart sustainability
and investments, will lead this
initiative in partnership with the
Mayor’s Office of Climate &
Environmental Justice (MOCEJ).
Climate budgeting will be
continuous and include an annual
publication that will be part of
the City’s Executive Budget.
This climate budget publication
will highlight the City’s new and
ongoing investments and provide
a snapshot of the projected
impacts of our collective actions
on the path toward meeting longterm climate goals. Monitoring
and reporting on progress
will ensure transparency and
accountability and will help guide
the City’s continued work. The
first Climate Budget publication
will be released in April 2024.

Climate Budgeting 
While the costs of preparing for
and responding to climate change
are significant, the cost of inaction
is far greater. Climate change
poses risks to our health, safety,
housing, environment, and economy,
and has a disproportionate impact
on communities that are already
vulnerable. Without climate
budgeting, we risk investing in
projects that are incompatible
with our long-term goals, locking
in technology that may harm
communities for decades, missing
opportunities to save money by
addressing multiple threats at
once, or stranding assets that are
paid for but must be abandoned
in the near future for better
alternatives. A budget informed
by climate science and equity
will ensure resources are used
effectively now and save the City
money in the long term.

CLIMATE
CONTEXT
To create a safer and more livable
city in the face of environmental
challenges, we must ground our work
in baseline conditions as well as future
projections. The following lays out the
key data and science behind this plan.
CLIMATE CHANGE
HAZARDS
Climate change is already impacting
our lives, not only during extreme
events but on a regular basis. In
September 2021, extreme rainfall from
Hurricane Ida broke the city’s hourly
rainfall record with unprecedented
flooding far from the coastline—killing
13 New Yorkers and causing hundreds
of millions of dollars of damage.12
In December of 2022, a nor’easter
caused coastal flooding in southern
Brooklyn and Queens, stranding
New Yorkers at home and in transit,
and putting a halt to many daily
activities.13 Additionally, the National
Climate Assessment reclassified New
York City’s climate from a “humid
continental” to a “humid subtropical”
climate in 2020, meaning that on
average our summers and winters
are both increasingly hotter.14 The

summer of 2022 was one of the
warmest in NYC’s history and
the winter of 2022-23 set record
temperature highs as well.15
Our understanding of the four major
climate hazards in New York City—
extreme heat, coastal storm surge,
chronic tidal flooding, and extreme
rainfall—are informed by the latest
projections from the New York City
Panel on Climate Change (NPCC).
The NPCC provides up-to-date
climate projections for use by the City
and our agencies in climate-related
decision-making. NPCC will publish
a Special Climate Report in summer
2023.16 The graphs in this introduction
section reflect the latest data, while
some maps and figures in subsequent
chapters reflect 2019 data.
Extreme Heat
In an average year in the 2030s, there
are projected to be up to three times
as many days with temperatures over
90 degrees Fahrenheit (°F) and up to
nearly four times as many heat waves
as there have been in the recent past.17
Average annual temperatures are also
projected to increase.18
Coastal Storm Surge
Our coasts are vulnerable to
flooding from storm events such
as hurricanes, tropical storms,
and nor’easters. A storm surge
occurs when atmospheric pressure
changes and wind associated with
a storm event causes a rush of
water onto land with the potential
to significantly damage coastal
communities and infrastructure.
New York City’s low-lying coastal
communities are currently exposed
to coastal surge flooding with nearly
a sixth of the city’s land area in the
100-year floodplain, based on the
Federal Emergency Management
Agency’s (FEMA’s) 2015 Preliminary
Flood Insurance Rate Map (PFIRM).
This area contains more than
400,000 residents and roughly
14,500 private businesses that
employ about 270,000 people.19 Over
time, as sea levels rise, the floodplain
will reach further inland.
Chronic Tidal Flooding
Chronic tidal flooding occurs when
low-lying areas off the coast are
inundated with water absent a
storm event. Today there are natural
variations in the tides that cycle with
the moon, which can be observed at
beaches, where water levels rise and
fall over the course of a day. As sea
levels continue to rise, the highest
tides will come further onto land,
causing flooding more frequently and
in more communities—even on sunny
days with no rain or coastal storm
event. By the 2080s, large portions
of some coastal neighborhoods
could flood more than every
other week on average, such as
communities around Jamaica Bay.20
Extreme Rainfall
While Hurricane Sandy was a wake-up
call to our coastal communities,
the more recent Hurricane Ida
underscored an emerging threat—
stormwater flooding. Extreme rainfall
events are becoming more frequent,
and the city will likely experience
more days with high amounts
of rainfall in the future, disrupting
and even potentially taking the lives
of New Yorkers.21 In between
extreme rainfall events, the city
may experience short-term drought,
impacting ecological habitats.
Without intervention, coastal and
inland communities across the city
will continue to face these hardships.
Sea levels in New York City have already risen by a foot since 1900 and are
expected to rise by up to 5.4 additional feet by the end of the century, contributing
to chronic tidal flooding and heightened coastal storm surge. Projected increases
are relative to a 1995–2014 baseline and are shown as low (10th to 25th percentile),
middle (25th to 75th percentile), and high (75th to 90th percentile) estimate ranges.

CLIMATE CONTEXT
GREENHOUSE GAS
EMISSIONS INVENTORY
While we must respond to the
climate hazards we are already
experiencing, we must also take swift,
bold action to lead the transition to
net-zero emissions as our city and
planet depend on us to stem the
worst potential impacts of climate
change in the future. This year, NYC
measured emissions from household
consumption and integrated it into
our GHG inventory for the first time.
Household consumption includes
life cycle emissions from the
consumption of food, energy, and
services by New York City residents.
The integrated inventory found that
GHG emissions from household
consumption are lower in NYC
than in surrounding areas, and
lower than the national average,
but are still a large component
of our city’s total emissions.
Since 2005, NYC’s annual GHG
inventory has guided our climate
policy priorities and has allowed us
to track our progress in reducing
emissions. The inventory has shown
us that, within the five boroughs,
energy used in buildings is our largest
source of emissions, followed by
energy used for transportation and
emissions generated from solid waste
and wastewater.22 These insights have
been the foundation of much of the
The NYC Citywide Greenhouse Gas Inventory,
which uses the Global Protocol for Cities
(GPC) methodology, measures emission levels
by source and tracks the City’s progress in
reducing them. Stationary energy, or energy
used for buildings, is the largest source
of emissions, followed by energy used for
transportation, and emissions generated from
solid waste and wastewater.

Environmental Justice, 2023.
last 15 years of policymaking and have
supported world-leading legislation
such as energy benchmarking, building
energy grades, and NYC’s building
performance standard, Local Law 97.23
However, many of our goods and
services are produced outside of
New York City’s borders and have not
traditionally been counted as a part
of the GHG inventory. This means
that our traditional inventory does not
account for the full carbon impact of
our activities or identify opportunities
to holistically reduce global emissions.
By adding the new household
consumption-based inventory to our
citywide inventory, we have created an
integrated inventory for the first time
that provides a more complete picture
of our carbon emissions.
The integrated inventory reveals that
emissions from our food consumption
comes in as a close third, behind
buildings and transportation.24 More
specifically, our consumption of
healthcare services, natural gas,
meats, poultry, fish, and eggs, as
well as eating at restaurants, are
all significant sources of emissions.
Having a more complete picture of our
GHG emissions as New Yorkers offers
valuable insights on how awareness,
programs, and policies can help us
reduce emissions from what and how
we consume goods and services.
In addition to the new integrated
inventory, we also calculated our
emissions using the New York
State Climate Leadership and
Community Protection Act (CLCPA)
methodology from 2019—making
us the first city in the state to take
this on.25 This inventory incorporates
emissions from imported electricity
and fossil fuels used to power
our buildings, transportation, and
electricity grid. It also highlights
the near-term warming impacts of
methane, a potent greenhouse gas
that results from fugitive natural gas
emissions, fossil fuel combustion,
landfills, and wastewater treatment.
Under the CLCPA methodology,
NYC’s calculated base year
(2005) emissions increased by
54%, highlighting the importance
of accounting for natural gas and
methane emissions.26 Using the
CLCPA methodology also narrowed
the reduction in emissions since
2005, observed in our traditional
citywide inventory, from 18% to
12%.27 This analysis will further inform
grid greening, building retrofits, and
electrification efforts across the city.
In sum, the City has developed three
inventories that provide a more
holistic picture of our GHG emissions
from different perspectives:

• NYC Integrated Inventory
• NYC CLCPA Inventory

CLIMATE CONTEXT
PUBLIC HEALTH
Climate change is the most pervasive
and persistent public health crisis
across the globe. Increasing
temperatures, coastal flooding, and
extreme rainfall all place people’s
health at risk both now and in the
future. We embark on climate action
to enable New Yorkers to live their
best lives in a sustainable and
healthy city, with clean and safe air,
homes, and public spaces.
Air pollution, including pollutants like
fine particulates (PM2.5), nitrogen
dioxide, nitric oxide, and sulfur
dioxide, has decreased dramatically
over the past decades as measured
by NYC’s neighborhood level air
monitoring program, the NYC
Community Air Survey.28 These
improvements are a result of CIty,
State, and Federal regulations for
emissions from vehicles, power
plants and the fuel we use to heat
our buildings. While levels of PM2.5
in NYC are now below EPA National
Air Quality Standards, the City still
has work to do.29 Studies have
shown that there is no safe level of
PM2.5, the pollutant most harmful to
health.30 Further, ground-level ozone
concentrations, another unhealthy
pollutant, have remained constant
over time.31 Addressing ozone is more
complicated than other emissions as
it is formed from pollutants emitted
both inside and outside of NYC. More
ozone is formed on hotter days, so as
temperatures continue to rise, so will
ozone levels.32 As the City reduces
NYC PM2.5 EMISSIONS BY BOROUGH
GHG emissions, these actions will
have the added benefits of reducing
air pollution.
Although New York City’s air is
significantly cleaner than it was a
decade ago, poor air quality-related
health impacts in environmental justice
communities remain a significant
challenge.33 Public health inequities
remain for communities of color and
low-income communities, which bear
the burden of higher rates of asthma,
respiratory disease, heart disease,
and even death. For example, heart
disease hospitalizations caused by
outdoor air pollution are twice as high
in low-income communities as they
are in wealthier communities.34 These
same communities also experience

highest rates in environmental

South Bronx and Harlem,
between 2015–2017.
The concentration of harmful pollutants such as fine
particulates (PM2.5) in NYC’s air has declined substantially
over the past decade, a result of City, State, and
Federal regulations.

Half of the fine particulates (PM2.5) in NYC’s air result from buildings, primarily due to commercial
cooking and the emissions associated with charbroilers. Targeting major sources of PM2.5 is key to

disproportionately greater emissions
from heavy-duty diesel vehicles, which
are major sources of nitrogen oxides
and PM2.5 in NYC.35
Indoor air pollution also affects
New York City residents. It is closely
tied to housing quality, with disrepair,
mold, and pests all resulting in poor
health outcomes for residents.36
Climate efforts to electrify and
retrofit buildings for efficiency
provide opportunities to reduce
GHG emissions and provide cleaner
air and more efficient buildings.
Recent research gives us a more
complete picture of the impacts
of gas stoves on air quality. Gas
stoves, which are in three quarters
of NYC households, contribute
heavily to indoor air pollution by
emitting PM2.5, nitrogen dioxide,
and carbon monoxide, which are
linked to respiratory system damage,
premature death, and developmental
delays in young children.37
The same communities that suffer
from higher environmental burdens
and poor public health outcomes on
a daily basis also bear the brunt of
the impacts during a public health
crisis, from the COVID-19 pandemic to
climate change. Heat is a public health
issue that is highly exacerbated by
climate change, and like other health
issues, extreme heat is experienced
unequally by New York City residents.
An average of 370 New Yorkers die
prematurely every summer due to
complications from heat, and these
deaths are entirely preventable.38
Most New Yorkers who die from heat
are exposed in overheated homes,
making residential cooling the most
effective way to prevent heat-related
deaths.39 Black New Yorkers are
also twice as likely as white New
Yorkers to die from heat and have less
access to air conditioning at home.40
Unreliable access to electricity,
whether due to power outages on
very hot days or unaffordable electric
bills, also impacts health.41 New
York’s lowest-income neighborhoods
and communities of color face the
highest risk of heat-related illness
and death because of both social and
environmental inequities.42
To maximize public health benefits,
our actions to address climate
change need to also address
environmental exposures and provide
social opportunities.

ENVIRONMENTAL
JUSTICE
Environmental justice is the principle
that all people, regardless of race,
disability, age, or socioeconomic
background, have a right to live,
work, and play in communities that
are safe, healthy, and free of harmful
environmental conditions. The
enivronmental justice movement,
which advocates for equal
protection and equal enforcement of
environmental laws and regulations,
including laws pertaining to public
health, recognizes that institutional
racism and class discrimination have
resulted in communities of color,
low-income neighborhoods, and
Indigenous people being the most
likely to be impacted by harmful
exposures, economic injustices, and
negative land uses.
Historically discriminatory housing
policies are one of many causes of
environmental injustice. Through
the process of redlining, housing
policy in the 1930s drew boundaries
around neighborhoods based on
race and deprived residents of
resources and opportunities.43 In
the following decades, the City
and State were building highways
that ripped through communities of

justice and make its findings public.
In summer 2023, MOCEJ will

a comprehensive view of the
present state of environmental
justice in New York City. This
report will be used to inform the

approximately 40,000 residents.44
Today, with an average of 300 diesel
trucks using the roadway every
hour and tens of thousands of cars
per day traveling in each direction,
the 220,000 New Yorkers who
live near the highway are regularly
exposed to elevated levels of noise,
air pollution, and excessive heat.45
Further, redlined neighborhoods
are more likely to face risks of
flooding and exacerbated impacts
from extreme heat. To address
this inequity, a Federal and City
partnership led to a $2 million
U.S. Department of Transportation
Rebuilding American Infrastructure
with Sustainability and Equity grant
to study and reimagine the CrossBronx Expressway.46
With an eye toward recognizing
the disparate impacts of climate
change and pollution and tackling
climate change with equity front and
center, the City will soon release the
Environmental Justice NYC (EJNYC)
Report, which will build on the work
in PlaNYC.
Many areas that were designated as grade D
(“Hazardous”) on the Home Owners’ Loan
Corporation (HOLC) Residential Security Maps
overlap with today’s environmental justice
communities. The redlining process that took
place in the 1930s contributed to a cycle of
disinvestment in certain neighborhoods and
subjected residents to health hazards that are
still being felt today.

A LIVABLE CITY for Every New Yorker
27
Climate change is not just a future threat,
it is a present danger that our communities
are already enduring. Warmer average
days, more frequent and longer heat
waves, severe rainstorms causing flooding,
and coastal storm surges reaching further
inland are just some of the ways New
Yorkers are already experiencing the
impacts of climate change. This extreme
weather disproportionately harms
communities of color and low-income
residents who have faced generations
of systemic racism, disinvestment, and
inequality. Climate change increases our
health risks and threatens our safety
with varying negative effects—death and
illness, home and business economic
losses, neighborhood damage, and
energy supply disruptions. New York City
has always been resilient in the face of
crisis and we will rise to the challenge of
mitigating the impacts of climate change.
Our unwavering commitment is to protect
and strengthen our city and lead the
way in reducing global greenhouse gas
emissions. Our plan includes achieving
sustainable, healthy, and resilient buildings,
and decarbonizing our energy supply.
We will aggressively mobilize support to
achieve our net-zero emissions goal by
2050 and prepare our communities for the
accelerating impacts of climate hazards
that threaten our livability.

outdoor urban heat impacts.
Since 2007, NYC has made great
strides toward keeping vulnerable
New Yorkers safe and cool indoors
and outdoors. To provide affordable
home cooling to vulnerable New
Yorkers, the City distributed more than
22,000 air conditioners through the
Home Energy Assistance Program
(HEAP), a Federally funded and
State-administered program, between
2015 and 2022, and in 2020 we
launched Get Cool NYC to distribute
and install nearly 73,000 free home
air conditioners during the COVID-19
pandemic when cooling center access
was limited.53 The City also launched
NYC CoolRoofs, which has coated
more than 11 million square feet of
rooftops with reflective material.54
In 2017, the City doubled down on
these efforts by targeting the most
at-risk neighborhoods—those with a
Heat Vulnerability Index score of 4 and
5—and released its first heat resilience
plan, Cool Neighborhoods NYC.
55 The
plan outlined the City’s commitment to
heat resilience, including investments
of nearly $100 million in tree planting,
climate risk training for home health
aides, and building improvements.56
Since then, 70% of the installations
of cool roofs have been in prioritized
high-Heat Vulnerability Index
areas.57 In September 2022, Mayor
Adams’ administration allocated
an additional $112 million for tree
planting, which will provide 36,000
new trees in Heat Vulnerability
Index neighborhoods.58 During the
COVID-19 pandemic, we committed
to helping New Yorkers beat the heat
through Cool It! NYC, a mapping
platform with hundreds of cooling
center locations and outdoor cooling
features such as drinking fountains,
tree cover, and water features in
heat-burdened neighborhoods.59
Despite our progress, many New
Yorkers still lack access to home
cooling systems, which are critical
to ensuring protection from extreme
heat. Too often, even those who have
air conditioning units do not use them
due to high energy costs. A 2020
survey of New Yorkers who received
free air conditioners through the
Get Cool NYC program found that the
cost of air conditioner units,
the cost of installation, and electricity
costs were the largest obstacles
for acquiring an air conditioner in
the past.60 To maximize cooling
benefits for the most vulnerable
New Yorkers, increasing access to
home cooling must be paired with
utility bill subsidies.
Protection from extreme heat in our
streets, buildings, and open spaces
will also mean a greener city for all
with improved air quality, more places
to relax, increased social resilience,
and other public health benefits.
Parallel to these efforts, the City will
continue to advocate for increased
grid reliability and resilience in
historically marginalized communities
that are particularly susceptible to
climate-related loss of power, and it
will prioritize lower energy bills for
New York City residents (see Clean
& Reliable Energy).
OUR PLAN
This plan will build upon the
tremendous progress the City has
already made. To ensure New Yorkers
are protected from extreme heat,
our plan will proactively mitigate heat
impacts while preparing for rising
temperatures and an increase in heat
waves. Our approach to keeping
New York cool will combat extreme
indoor heat and decrease the urban
heat island effect in our public realm.
Strategies including mandatory cooling
for new construction and a maximum
summer indoor temperature policy will
keep us safe at home, while expanding
the tree canopy and implementing
other outdoor cooling strategies will
keep our public spaces cool for all who
live, work, and play in NYC. The City is
also establishing Resilience Hubs that
build social, economic, and climate
resilience (see Buildings).

Extreme heat, heavy rain, and
coastal flooding all pose threats
to our health and safety. Heat is
the most imminent, killing more
New Yorkers every year than any
other type of extreme weather
event.47 Elderly New Yorkers are
highly vulnerable to heat-related
illnesses, and Black New Yorkers
are twice as likely to die from heat
stress than white New Yorkers.48
Heat-related health risks are only
increasing as the climate changes
and heat waves become more
frequent and intense, impacting
residents more acutely in certain
parts of our city. The average
number of days per year above 90
degrees Fahrenheit (°F) could be
as high as 69 days per year by the
2050s, approximately four times
the average from 1981 to 2010.49
While heat will impact all New
Yorkers, some feel the effects more
acutely than others. According
to the 2022 New York City HeatRelated Mortality Report, 81% of
in-home heat stroke related deaths
occurred in households without air
conditioning.50 Though more than
90% of city households reported
having air conditioning in 2017,
access was as low as 76% in certain
neighborhoods.51 Outdoor heat risk
is also exacerbated in certain areas
of the city where black pavement,
dark gray buildings, and streets
without trees increase the urban
heat island effect, making streets
hotter and more dangerous during
hot weather.
Residents in Central Brooklyn, Upper
Manhattan, and the South Bronx are
the most vulnerable to increasing
temperatures, according to the
Heat Vulnerability Index (HVI), which
maps relative risk for New Yorkers
from extreme heat events.52 Driven
by underlying health disparities,
a lack of access to indoor cooling,
and a relative lack of greenery,
communities of color, as well as
low-income and elderly residents,
This graphic shows the projected increase in
the annual number of days over 90 °F relative

Maximizing access to indoor cooling
will help save lives by prioritizing
investments in the most vulnerable
populations while reducing GHG
emissions. This can be achieved by
increasing access to air conditioners
as well as high-efficiency heat
pumps and lowering energy costs.  Develop a maximum summer
indoor temperature policy to
protect all New Yorkers from
extreme indoor heat by 2030
The feasibility of a maximum indoor
temperature standard has been
considered as far back as 2015, when
the City launched an urban heat island
working group. The City’s Housing
Maintenance Code already requires
that minimum temperatures be
maintained from October through May
to keep New Yorkers warm during colder
months. We will use this requirement as
a blueprint for developing a maximum
indoor temperature standard for the
summer months.61
Other areas of the country, such
as Dallas, Texas, and Montgomery
County, Maryland, have set maximum
indoor air temperature regulations,
Maximize access to
indoor cooling 1
providing precedents, models, and
lessons learned.62, 63 The World Health
Organization and the Occupational
Safety and Health Administration
have also issued maximum indoor air
temperature recommendations that
will inform our work.64, 65 Development
of an equitable pathway to a maximum
indoor temperature policy will need to
consider the percentage of household
income spent on energy costs, also
known as energy burden, as well as
safeguards for the most vulnerable
New Yorkers from heat-related
illnesses and deaths.  Include mandatory cooling
requirements for new
construction by 2025
The City’s GHG emissions reduction
targets encourage the adoption of
more efficient building energy systems.
As insulation, cooling, and heating
systems improve, we will push to
include mandatory cooling for new
construction. Though cooling is not yet
explicitly required in new construction,
it has become a building industry
standard. Codifying the standard will
make access to indoor cooling part of
our new baseline for quality living. We
have already started to implement this
in other City contexts; NYC Housing
Preservation and Development’s
(HPD’s) Design Guidelines were
recently updated to include cooling
(see Buildings). Knowing that universal
access to cooling will increase loads
on our energy grid, we are also
encouraging more energy-efficient
cooling technologies such as heat
pumps (see Buildings).

“Before I got the air conditioner, my apartment, which
faces the rising sun, was like Dante’s Inferno. No matter
how many shades you pull down it didn’t stop the heat.
I’m asthmatic. I was in the senior center and the Resident
Leader came in and asked if I needed an AC. I knew quite a
few elderly people who didn’t have air conditioners and they
got them, too. I’m the baby of my bunch and I try to look
out for the others. After the AC, I was able to sit comfortably
for hours in a chair. I felt like there were people out there
with hearts. The cooling centers are good but they’re not
your own home, and some of our residents have a hard time
getting down the elevators to go to them. There is too much
on the shoulders of the retired elderly. It’s getting hotter out
there and people need to look up.”

SPOTLIGHT
A neighborhood’s design
contributes to how people
experience heat. Dark surfaces,
building materials, and a lack
of green space make buildings,
public spaces, and neighborhoods
hotter. A hotter public realm
can deter pedestrian activity
and increase the likelihood of
heat-related illness and injury
for outdoor workers. Investing
in outdoor cooling strategies
helps us mitigate the urban heat
island effect and create a more
livable city for all New Yorkers.
Our Heat Vulnerability Index
(HVI) shows that neighborhoods
with scores of 4 or 5 have the
highest risk from extreme heat.74
Because our plans and designs for
buildings and spaces can greatly
affect the temperature, we have
developed a suite of outdoor
cooling strategies that support
these high-risk communities.
 Install 1 million square feet of
cool roofs annually
We plan to invest in our built
environment with cool roofs,
corridors, and pavement that
can lower outdoor temperatures
by reflecting more sunlight
and absorbing less heat. The
CoolRoofs workforce training
program aims to coat 1 million
square feet of rooftops per year
with materials that have high
solar reflectance. Further, in areas
where expanding green space is
not feasible, the City will explore
opportunities to develop cool
pavement projects and will pilot a
pipeline of Cool Corridors projects
in four high-heat areas across
the city. These programs will also
provide opportunities to train
hundreds of New Yorkers for jobs
in the green economy.

CITY LEADING BY EXAMPLE
NYC Housing
Authority (NYCHA)
Clean Heat for All
Challenge
In 2022, NYCHA, in partnership
with the New York Power Authority
and the New York State Energy
Research and Development
Authority (NYSERDA),
announced the establishment of
the Clean Heat for All Challenge.70
The program will invest $70 million
in 30,000 new heat pump units
for New York City public housing
and is a stellar example of partnering
to achieve climate solutions and
increase energy efficiency for
overburdened communities.71
One in 16 New Yorkers lives in
NYCHA housing.72 Heat pumps
provide efficient cooling and
heating from a single unit that
is four times more efficient than
traditional equipment like boilers.73
The heat pump units developed
to meet this challenge will enable
rapid, low-cost electrification
of space heating and cooling by
reducing or eliminating many of
the cost drivers involved with heat
pump installation in residentoccupied apartments, such as
electrical system upgrades, lengthy
refrigerant piping, and throughwall drilling and penetrations.
The advanced heating and cooling
solutions will reduce GHG
emissions and improve the indoor
comfort of NYCHA residents.
 Reform the Home Energy
Assistance Program to
cover equipment and
energy costs for cooling
The Home Energy Assistance Program
(HEAP) summer Cooling Assistance
Component, helps vulnerable
populations stay cool by providing
funding for the purchase and installation
of an air conditioner or fan priced up
to $800 from a list of State-approved
vendors.66 However, the program
criteria limits eligibility to residents with
a documented medical condition that
is exacerbated by extreme heat.67 The
program is also focused only on upfront
costs for cooling. Although HEAP helps
low-income households offset the costs
of heating their homes in the winter,
the program lacks utility bill assistance
in the summer.68 The cost of running
an air conditioner can be prohibitively
high for low-income households where
comparatively higher energy burdens
already exist.
HEAP is Federally funded and
administered by New York State, which
sets the benefit amounts and eligibility
requirements. We will advocate for HEAP
reform at the State and Federal levels
to both simplify or eliminate medical
documentation requirements, allow
for the purchase of heat pumps to
provide energy-efficient cooling, and
to include new electric utility benefits
that subsidize summer cooling costs
from June to September. Further, we
will advocate for an overall increase in
funding at the State and Federal level
for Cooling Assistance Component
benefits for the purchase and
installation of air conditioners. We will
also explore whether existing rental
support programs, such as Senior
Citizen Rent Increase Exemption, can
be expanded to cover utility support.69

Trees play a critical role in reducing
outdoor temperatures by providing
shade on hot days and purifying
the air we breathe. Urban trees can
cool city streets up to 2°F, shading
buildings and reducing energy
consumption.78 Trees also beautify
our streets and neighborhoods
and enhance the overall look
and feel of our public spaces.
The City planted 11,634 trees in
the highest Heat Vulnerability
Index zones between fiscal years
2018 and 2022, and in September
2022, Mayor Adams’ administration
invested an additional $112 million
for tree planting, which will provide
36,000 new trees in heat
vulnerable neighborhoods.79
Achieve a 30%

3
According to an analysis by the
Nature Conservancy, there are 42,656
acres of tree canopy citywide on both
public and private land, representing
22% of our land area.80 By preserving
and maintaining our existing trees
and planting new trees, we will
work to achieve a 30% tree canopy
cover—representing 15,388 additional
acres of tree canopy. New trees will
be targeted in city parks and public
rights-of-way, including along bike
lanes and major pedestrian routes to
subway stations, cooling centers, and
other key destinations. We will also
leverage public-private partnerships
to maximize tree replacement,
planting, and preservation on private
land to achieve our urban tree canopy
expansion goals.
 Expand the Tree Risk
Management Program, and in
2023, establish the Climber and
Pruner Training Program pilot
NYC Parks is responsible for the
direct management of more than
800,000 street and landscaped
park trees.81 Increased inspections
of individual park and street trees
and a well-trained workforce will
help identify and correct defects
early, preventing tree decay and
saving healthy trees. In 2017, NYC
Parks transitioned to a Tree Risk
Cool Corridors 
In 2021, DOT was awarded a
$320,500 FEMA Building Resilient
Infrastructure and Communities
(BRIC) grant, which is being
matched with $110,000 to develop
a Cool Corridors toolkit.75 Cool
Corridors are streets with features
like shade structures, reflective
materials, and enhanced green
spaces that help mitigate the
impacts of the urban heat island
effect, making it safer and easier for
New Yorkers to walk, run, or relax
in public spaces during summer
months. The BRIC program
provides funding to states, local
communities, tribes, and territories
that are working on hazard
mitigation projects that reduce
the risk from flooding, extreme
heat, and other extreme weather
events.76 This grant was one of
only two heat mitigation FEMA
 Invest in pools and swim safety
programs in environmental
justice communities
Every summer, thousands of New
Yorkers head to our public beaches
and swimming pools to beat the
heat. The City offers a variety of
swimming programs to ensure pool
users can cool off safely. As our
summers become longer and hotter,
we plan to invest in environmental
justice communities by offering
more drowning-prevention and swim
education and emphasizing access
to pools for the most vulnerable New
Yorkers. We have been mapping
“pool deserts” in our city and are
working to build and repair public
pools in areas that have the least
access, to hire and retain lifeguards,
and to provide year-round access to
pools. Increased options for staying
cool during hot weather will enable
us to protect our communities
while we continue to invest in our
infrastructure and systems to
create a more heat-resilient NYC.
BRIC grants awarded nationwide.
The Cool Corridors toolkit will
help the City develop projects
for streets to lower outdoor
temperatures during summer
months. It will also help the City
pursue future FEMA funding to
implement Cool Corridor projects
in our most heat vulnerable
communities by creating a new
way to measure the impacts
of different cooling strategies.
Aside from BRIC, other Federal
and State grants could support
work to address extreme heat,
such as the Federal Healthy
Streets Program, which is
designed to provide financial
assistance for projects to
decrease the urban heat island
effect, especially in environmental
justice neighborhoods.77
Management Program aligned with
the latest industry standards.82 Tree
Risk Management incorporates
public service requests and routine
tree inspections to identify and
rate existing risks while addressing
conditions presenting the highest
risk to public safety and property
first. This program will allow us to
inspect trees and identify concerns
before they become major issues,
establishing systematic, preventive
tree care. For example, prompt
pruning of single decaying branches
helps trees grow strong and healthy
so they can continue to keep us cool.
We will also establish and fund
an NYC Parks Climber and Pruner
Training Program pilot to provide
tree care training, generate jobs,
and offer public information.
 Ensure that all new buildings
meet the City’s street tree
planting requirements through
improved enforcement by 2035
To preserve our growing tree
canopy for current and future
generations of New Yorkers, we
will strengthen our regulations. As
highlighted in the Get Stuff Built plan,
the City will improve coordination on
street tree requirements for
new construction.83

tree preservation and maximizing
planting opportunities, can help mitigate
negative impacts from construction.
We will improve collaboration among
City agencies to incorporate the latest
design and preservation techniques
into infrastructure projects. We will also
explore ways to incorporate new tree
growth into other project types. The
City is exploring Leadership in Energy
and Environmental Design (LEED)
implementation for the Urban Heat
Island (UHI) index and expanding the
tree canopy through Climate Resiliency
Design Guidelines pilot sites. The
Climate Resiliency Design Guidelines
provide forward-looking design criteria
to incorporate climate change data
into the design of City facilities. These
guidelines will be mandatory for all City
projects by 2027. City projects will also
target tree plantings and maintenance
in the most heat-vulnerable
communities, design for larger tree
growing spaces, and use proven
engineering techniques in planting.

EXTREME HEAT
FLOODING
As the frequency of severe storms
increases, NYC is experiencing a
heightened need for flood protection.
Just over a decade ago, Hurricane
Sandy showed how vulnerable our
city was to coastal storm surge. But
storms do not need to be as extreme
as Sandy to cause significant
property damage, disruption
to critical infrastructure, and
displacement of residents. Recent
winter storms, including in 2022,
have revealed our vulnerability to
even moderate storm events outside
of hurricane season. As climate
change causes sea levels to rise,
flooding that occurs during high tides
(also called sunny-day flooding) will
also become an increasingly chronic
issue for shoreline communities.
In 2021, Hurricanes Henri and
Ida demonstrated that extreme
rainfall can be equally dangerous,
especially in low-lying inland areas
that are prone to flooding.84 While
NYC has always received regular
rainfall—in fact, it rains for roughly
a third of the days each year—the
torrential downpours of Henri and
Ida quickly overwhelmed the drainage
systems that were built to rainfall
patterns of the past.85 Such storms
cause stormwater to accumulate
on streets and enter basements,
either flowing downward through
windows and doors or upward
through indoor fixtures as sewer
backups. Flood risk for both inland
and coastal areas is increasing, and
extreme rainfall events are becoming
more frequent and disruptive. Unlike
coastal flooding, rain-driven flooding
can occur suddenly and intensely
with highly localized impacts.
Projections for increasing chronic
tidal flooding, more frequent coastal
storm events, and significant flooding
from heavy rain events demonstrate
the need to act throughout the five
boroughs to improve infrastructure
and increase resilience for all New
Yorkers. Increased flooding comes at
a significant cost: Hurricane Sandy
alone cost NYC $19 billion, a nearly
incomprehensible figure that included
extensive damage to infrastructure
and private property across multiple
coastal neighborhoods.86
Homes purchased in New York
State in 2021 that have experienced
flooding in the past are expected
to cost homeowners another $23
million each year moving forward
in annual flood damages.87 More
importantly, flood preparedness is
a matter of life safety, particularly
in immigrant, low-income, and
rental communities, as well as for
populations with limited mobility and
the elderly. Fourty-four New Yorkers
lost their lives during Hurricane
Sandy in 2012;88 nearly a decade
later, we lost another 13 lives during
Hurricane Ida, with most of those
lives lost tragically in basement
apartments.89 Some city residents
are facing repeated flooding that
causes financial damages and puts
their lives at risk. It is crucial that we
take decisive action to mitigate the
risks of flooding and protect people,
infrastructure, and property.
NYC has engaged in large-scale,
complex projects to increase our
resilience since Hurricane Sandy.
The City has preserved 10,000
acres of wetlands at Jamaica Bay to
mitigate coastal storms and invested
more than $3 billion in resilience
funding to protect NYC Housing
Authority (NYCHA) residents.90, 91 We
have started massive coastal projects
in Manhattan, Queens, Brooklyn,
and Staten Island to protect against
storm surge flooding. We have built
or upgraded 226 miles of sewer
infrastructure, especially focused on
areas like Southeast Queens that
have been historically underserved.92
We have also proactively deployed
green infrastructure solutions,
including construction of nearly
13,000 rain gardens and similar
assets,93 installation of more
than 17,000 linear feet of porous
pavement for water capture,94 and
completion of 84 Bluebelt projects
that use nature-based solutions to
cost-effectively improve drainage.95
We now understand our flood risk
much better, including the impacts
that floods can have on homes,
businesses, and finances.
At the individual property level, we
helped 12,500 families recover from
Hurricane Sandy through the Build It
Back program by providing resources
to repair, rebuild, elevate, or relocate
homes.96 With extensive outreach
and education in partnership with
FEMA and FloodHelpNY, we have
seen an increase of approximately
50% in National Flood Insurance
Program enrollment since 2012.97
We also launched Business PREP to
help small businesses prepare for
emergencies like those caused by
extreme weather. This Small Business
Services (SBS) program served
560 businesses impacted by Sandy.
After Hurricane Ida, we expanded
the program to serve an additional
450 businesses citywide with an
additional investment of more than $5
million.98 More recently, we released
Housing Our Neighbors: A Blueprint
for Housing and Homelessness, which
prioritizes keeping New Yorkers safe
in their homes during flood events
and addresses the needs of our most
vulnerable residents, including those
living in basement apartments.99
With an eye toward scale and speed,
we must expand our scope to advance
toward a citywide approach to flood
resilience. We will use data to identify
locations that we may not be able to
protect from increased climate risks
and take action to help residents move
voluntarily, opening up the use of these
properties to help protect surrounding
neighborhoods from flooding.
OUR PLAN
True flood resilience advances
solutions at every scale from
citywide standards to neighborhood
projects to individual parcels and
assets. First, we must continue
to implement the many resilience
projects that are already underway
in all five boroughs. Second, we must
develop a citywide approach for flood
resilience that encapsulates both
coastal inundation and stormwater.
This plan builds on past work to
address flooding and will impact
the entire lifecycle of an asset from
conception to operation. Flood
resilience must be considered well
before a project is built. We must
also contend with our current built
environment. We will continue to
pilot the City’s Climate Resiliency
Design Guidelines. We will develop
minimum flood resilience standards
for shoreline assets and establish
a citywide level of service for
stormwater infrastructure. This
will ensure that New York City’s
coastal communities, as well as
vulnerable inland communities,
are invested in and protected.
To date, there has not been a
single agency fully responsible for
overseeing the entire city’s flood
risk. We will task the Department
of Environmental Protection (DEP)
with this so that stormwater and
coastal flooding are managed by
one agency that can integrate
planning and implementation. DEP
will coordinate across the many City
agencies and partners that will need
to do their part in protecting New
Yorkers from flood risk, whether it
is because their core missions are
deeply affected or because they own
and operate waterfront property.
Finally, we will address the fact that
we cannot protect every address
in NYC from future flood risk with
infrastructure. To that end, we will
develop an entity that can support
flood-prone property owners and
renters with housing options. While
the City should not become a buyer
of last resort for residents who want
to sell their homes, we can and
should use Federal and State dollars
to strategically purchase property
where homeowners choose to
leave flood-prone properties. These
properties could be repurposed
as resilient infrastructure that can
protect the rest of a neighborhood.
Create a new leadership
structure for coastal flood
resilience in 2023, headed
by the Department of
Environmental Protection.
Implement a multilayered
strategy for flood resilience:
• Develop minimum flood
resilience standards for
shoreline assets by 2026
• Continue to design and
construct world-class
neighborhood scale coastal
protection projects and
partner with the United
States Army Corps of
Engineers’ (USACE) New
York & New Jersey Harbor
& Tributaries Feasibility
Study (NYNJHATS) process
• Develop a stormwater
flooding adaptation plan by
2024 to establish a citywide
flood protection target for
stormwater infrastructure
• Create nature-based
stormwater management
solutions that provide
multiple functions, including
shade, water and air
quality improvement,
and wildlife habitats
Launch a voluntary housing
mobility and land acquisition
program to provide housing
counseling and facilitate
future land acquisition with
Federal and State funds:
• Enable the City to engage
with interested residents
and acquire difficult to
protect flood-vulnerable
properties that can support
flood control, natural areas,
or parklands

2 inches of rain falls in one hour (left). An
extreme stormwater flood event is a 1%
annual chance event in which approximately
3.5 inches of rain falls in one hour (right).
Both moderate and extreme stormwater
flooding events are projected to increase
in frequency and intensity over time.
Additionally, sea level rise can exacerbate
this flooding by blocking outfalls which can
make it harder for the sewer system to

The Seaport Coastal Resilience
project, first identified during
the Financial District and
Seaport Climate Resilience
Master Plan process, was
recently selected by FEMA
for a BRIC grant maximum
award of $50 million.100, 101
Without intervention, Lower
Manhattan faces risk from sea
level rise and is expected to
see monthly flooding by the
2050s, and daily flooding by the
2080s.102 Large coastal storms
and extreme precipitation
also present a significant risk
to the neighborhood. The
area is subject to a “bathtub”
effect because the waterfront
is at higher elevation than
adjacent inland areas. This
means that flood waters are
easily trapped on streets and
around buildings without the
ability to naturally drain back
out into the East River.103
This project proposes raising
the shoreline from the Brooklyn
Bridge to Imagination
Playground. The Federal funds
will help provide potential
esplanade improvements,
ecological enhancements, and
green infrastructure to manage
stormwater. Neighborhood-scale

this showcase the benefit of
Federal funding to advance
other large resilience projects
across the five boroughs.

Flooding needs to be considered
holistically due to compounding

to ensure that when we are preventing
storm surge from coming onto land,
we are not exacerbating flooding

The City has been awarded funds
through FEMA’s Flood Mitigation
Assistance grant to undertake a
citywide study to determine where
backwater valves will be most
effective in reducing flood risk
and stopping sewage backups. A
backwater valve can prevent sewer
water from backing up into your
home through basement plumbing
fixtures such as toilets, sinks, and
drains. During heavy rain and
flooding, if water from the City
sewer rises to the level of basement
plumbing, the valve will close and
block sewer water from entering
your home. Plumbing backups are
unsanitary, can cause serious health
hazards, and are costly to clean up.
Backwater valves are important
tools to help minimize flood-related
damage and reduce the negative health
impacts of flooding.
Through this FEMA funded study,
the Department of Environmental
Protection, NYC Emergency
Management and the Mayor’s
Office of Climate & Environmental
Justice will assess characteristics and
conditions such as building type,
neighborhood sewer network, and
flood risk to determine the scale of
a possible installation program and
priority areas. The study will also
identify areas for direct community
outreach by identifying which buildings
and locations are most suitable for
backwater valves, as well as locations
where backwater valves may not
address concerns. Finally, it will
indicate where installations should

We will advance a multilayered strategy
to adapt our city to a future with
rising seas and more frequent storms,
ranging from neighborhood-scale
coastal protection to property-scale
flood resilience standards. We will plan
holistically for coastal and stormwater
flooding and consider the compound
risk of multiple hazards.
 Develop minimum flood
resilience standards for

The City has made significant progress
incorporating flood resilience into the
built environment, from updating the
building and zoning codes for coastal
properties in the floodplain to creating
Climate Resiliency Design Guidelines
that set a new standard for City
projects. The City has also leveraged
Federal funding to undertake largescale coastal projects that protect
entire neighborhoods.107
The next phase of our strategy will
incorporate coastal and stormwater
flood risk into all City decision-making.
As outlined in the Comprehensive
Waterfront Plan and the Housing Our

of Zoning for Coastal Flood Resiliency
and updates to Appendix G of the City’s
building code, we will develop new
resilience standards for buildings and
neighborhoods to address the impacts
of current and future stormwater

While coastal assets like bulkheads,
revetments, and salt marshes are
being rebuilt and enhanced along the
City’s 520 miles of shoreline, there
is currently no resilience standard
that applies to all types of waterfront
assets. A new minimum flood resilience
standard will seek to adapt our city’s
shoreline gradually so that when we
build at the water’s edge, we build to a
future climate standard that considers
higher tides and more frequent
coastal storms. We also recognize
that our coastline is not uniform, so
this standard must consider varying
conditions from soft natural shorelines
to hardened bulkheads to working
waterfronts and pile-supported
structures. Resilience means something
different for each of these asset types,
yet without action, almost all of our
waterfront will be subject to flooding
in the future, requiring a large-scale
response across all properties.

will define the next generation of
coastal projects and the City is
working to ensure that projects
are responsive to local needs and
conditions, in part by advocating that
these once-in-a-generation projects
meet the following conditions:
• Serve multiple purposes, address
multiple risks, and integrate into
the local urban context
• Deliver results as quickly and
efficiently as possible
• Use a cost-benefit analysis that
meaningfully incorporates social
and environmental benefits and
prioritizes socially vulnerable
populations

for sewer replacements and highlevel storm sewer construction.119
We will also invest in other innovative
solutions for stormwater capture.
This includes expanding the
City’s proven green infrastructure
program citywide, adding to the
portfolio of nearly 13,000 rain
gardens and other green features
that absorb stormwater.120 We will
expand the Bluebelt system where
feasible across the five boroughs,
building off successful projects on
Staten Island. Bluebelts combine
natural and engineered infrastructure
to enhance the ability of drainage
corridors like streams, ponds, and
wetlands to convey, store, and
filter stormwater runoff. Finally,
we will explore new approaches
to stormwater management, like
the Cloudburst program, which
uses specially engineered open
spaces or community amenities
to hold stormwater during brief,
heavy downpours.121 The City’s
A “cloudburst,” as seen during
Hurricane Ida, is a sudden, heavy
downpour that occurs in a short
amount of time and may lead
to flooding, property damage,
disruptions to critical
infrastructure, and pollution of
NYC’s waterways. Cloudburst
management implements a
combination of methods that
absorb, store, and transfer
stormwater to reduce flooding.
Using gray infrastructure (e.g.,
drainage pipes and underground
storage tanks) and green
infrastructure (e.g., rain gardens
and porous pavement), cloudburst
management can minimize damage
by reducing the strain on the
municipal sewer system.
DEP and NYCHA are designing
cloudburst pilot projects to protect
residents from these types of
intense rainfall events at South
Jamaica Houses in Queens and
Clinton Houses in Manhattan.
The South Jamaica Houses project
is expected to break ground this
year.126 NYCHA has continued
to advance cloudburst strategies
across their portfolio, completing
design at Jefferson Houses
in Manhattan and evaluating
proposals for cloudburst
infrastructure design services
at five additional developments
that have a high vulnerability to
flooding.127 The City is supporting
design and construction with
$84 million in capital funds to
combat high-intensity rain events
at NYCHA developments.128
In January 2023, the Adams
administration announced an
expansion of the cloudburst
program to four new
neighborhoods.129 Supported with
nearly $400 million in City capital
funds — and in partnership with
DEP, DOT, NYC Parks, and
NYCHA — these specially designed,
built, and engineered infrastructure
projects will protect residents and
property from future extreme
rainfall in Corona and Kissena Park,
Queens; Parkchester, Bronx; and
East New York, Brooklyn. More than
two dozen additional locations are
also being evaluated for inclusion.
This investment, and continued
advocacy for Federal and State
funds, cements NYC’s status as a
global leader in stormwater resilience.

75% are one- to four-family
homes, highlighting the urgent
need to address increased flood
risks for homeowners.137 HPD’s
HomeFix program helps low- and
moderate-income homeowners in
small, one- to four-unit properties
fund home repairs.138 Under
an expanded program, the City
will provide homeowners with
support for sustainability and
resilience retrofits, which includes
multiple strategies from installing
a backwater valve or flood
resistant materials to elevating
mechanical systems and buildings.
“Two Bridges, where I live, has the largest concentration of
subsidized housing on the waterfront anywhere in Manhattan
below 96th Street. They’re mostly transportation deserts with
immigrant communities, low-income people, and seniors. We
were put here to offset density. These developments were put
at the margins when the City was trying to counteract blight.
The upswing is that they put us on the waterfront. Asian and
Latino people go to the waterfront for fishing because that’s
how they grew up. Water means a lot to different cultures and
its meaning is passed down generationally.
The waterfront is a gift but it comes with a reminder of
our vulnerabilities.
For engagement to be effective, you have to invest in the
community and its character and learn holistically what needs
to happen for communication. I’m a big advocate of working
with preexisting community-based organizations that are
already in affected populations and have a proven track record.
They’re the ones who know how to communicate these risks.”

FLOODING
BUILDINGS
In the United States, we spend 90%
of our time indoors—living, working,
and playing inside buildings.140 We rely
on them for shelter and safety, and
the quality of indoor space impacts
our health and wellbeing. NYC has
more than 1 million buildings, and
more than 90% of them will still
exist in 2050.141 Buildings are also
responsible for almost 70% of total
citywide GHG emissions, which is
why we must improve our existing
buildings while driving toward new
low-carbon construction.142 Resilient
and efficient buildings enhance New
Yorkers’ health and comfort and are
more resilient in the face of climate
hazards, especially extreme heat.
In 2019, as part of the Climate
Mobilization Act, we passed Local
Law 97, which requires a reduction
in emissions from the city’s largest
buildings (those over 25,000 square
feet in size) by 2030 and carbon
neutrality by 2050.143 Local Law
97 emissions reduction targets for
municipal operations are stricter
than those for private buildings: 40%
by 2025 and 50% by 2030.144 Since
buildings are the largest source
of emissions in NYC, fulfilling the
objectives of Local Law 97 is crucial
to achieving our climate goals. Yet
some owners face financial challenges
to retrofitting or are resistant to
change. Capital improvement costs
to low-income households and
other buildings, including rent
regulated and affordable housing,
can be financially burdensome.
The free, one-on-one, City-run
NYC Accelerator program serves
a valuable advisory role by helping
building owners and developers
identify actionable upgrades that
will help them comply with Local
Law 97 and access applicable
financial incentives and programs;
yet more is needed to achieve
full compliance with the law.
For new buildings, City and State
policies have ensured that, beginning
next year, new construction in
NYC will be on the path to carbon
neutral operations by 2040.
There are three drivers behind
this success. In December 2021,
the City enacted Local Law 154,
mandating new buildings be built to
operate without fossil fuel systems
beginning in 2024.145 Second, the
City adopted progressively more
efficient Energy Conservation Codes,
resulting in extremely efficient new
construction. Finally, the State’s
Climate Leadership Community
Protection Act committed the State
to a 70% renewable grid by 2030
and a zero-emission grid by 2040.146
Beyond addressing operational
emissions of buildings, the City
is also examining emissions from
its own construction projects. In
September 2022, Mayor Adams
signed Executive Order 23 to
cut GHG emissions from City
construction projects and ensure any
Federally funded new construction
will use sustainable materials,
equipment, and practices.147
In addition, in the decade since
Hurricane Sandy, we are continuing
to make the city’s buildings more
resilient, including adopting Zoning
for Coastal Flood Resiliency in 2021
and updating the NYC Building
Code, which is now one of the
most stringent flood resilience
standards in the country.148 NYC
is sparking a movement, inspiring
cities, states, and the Federal
government to adopt similar
building standards and practices.
Still, our challenges are manifold:
we must decouple the growth in
buildings from growth in emissions
while equitably decarbonizing and
retrofitting existing building stock. By
facing and meeting these challenges,
all New Yorkers, including the most
vulnerable communities, will have
access to the opportunities and
benefits of living in a low-carbon
and resilient society, including
cleaner air and safer homes.
OUR PLAN
Local Law 97 will drive a once-ina-generation investment in NYC’s
clean energy economy. We will
provide tools and resources to help
building stakeholders and industry
partners meet Local Law 97 targets.
To achieve full implementation of
Local Law 97, the City will finalize
its rulemaking and enforcement
mechanisms, and ensure alignment
with existing City and State laws
and regulations. The City will also
communicate clearly to the public
and offer robust, direct outreach to
property owners and stakeholders.
We are also looking closely at
affordable housing. NYC Housing
Preservation and Development
(HPD) will retrofit existing
affordable housing to be allelectric. Programs such as HPD’s
Retrofit Electrification Pilot and
their recently released Design
Guidelines for Preservation contain
innovative design principles for
climate adaptation, resilience, and
improved health of residents.149
Our plan will also reinforce NYC’s
leading efforts in phasing out fossil
fuels, reducing air pollution, and
implementing clean construction.
We will reduce reliance on fossil
fuels in City-owned and operated
buildings by beginning to phase out
spending on fossil fuel equipment
and infrastructure. In addition,
to support efforts to reduce air
pollution, we will develop a new
air quality monitoring program
to better understand localized
air quality impacts. Lastly, we
will require the City’s capital
project agencies to commit to
actions that lower embodied
carbon, which encompasses
GHG emissions arising from the
manufacture, transportation,
installation, maintenance, and
disposal of building materials. The
City will use the data we collect
from minimizing carbon in City
construction projects to inform a
future citywide mitigation policy. We
will also work with industry partners
to gain experience with low-carbon
construction materials and methods.

“I’m a nerd when it comes to anything technical. I will go
down a rabbit hole and read. New York is more green than
other cities because of its density but it’s crazy to waste all
that heat, especially in old tenement buildings with these
boiler and steam radiator systems. Tenants are keeping their
windows open and the landlord is throwing away money.
There needs to be a way that we cannot do that.
When we made our building changes, it was due to aging
infrastructure and comfort issues. We had a two-pipe
hydronic system with seasonal switchover. This meant that
in “shoulder season,” in-between weather, some people
were cold and some were hot depending on their side of the
building. Our system was old and reaching the end of its
life. I wanted to get out ahead of it and understand how we
could do better.
We are replacing all the in-apartment heating units
with fan coil heat pumps, as well as the central plants.
The new system will use the same two pipes, but if you
want it to be colder, you’ll turn on your individual heat
pump. It acts like a refrigerator unit and dumps the
excess heat into that water loop. If someone on the other
side of the building wants heat, they’re getting yours.
Our building will be compliant to 2030 standards by
summer 2023.”

Residential and multifamily buildings
make up the largest sector of buildings
subject to Local Law 97, and their
compliance is essential to achieving
NYC’s climate goals. Many buildings
with affordable units will be subject
to compliance with GHG emissions
limits in the coming years. Achieving
a just transition means addressing
the challenges faced by underserved
communities as we shift toward a
low-carbon society while sharing
the benefits and opportunities fairly.
To that end, the City is prioritizing
climate investments and retrofits for
public and affordable housing through
NYCHA and HPD.
 Install window heat pumps
in 10,000 NYCHA units and
unlock Federal funding for
further upgrades and efficiency
investments by 2030
Heat pumps are high-efficiency
electric appliances that provide
heating and cooling. Because they
are placed on rooftops, or through
walls or windows, rather than in
basements, they are less likely to be
damaged during flood events. Air
source heat pumps can be powered
Electrifying our building systems
and powering them with renewable
energy can significantly reduce GHG
emissions, improve air quality, and
reduce negative health outcomes.
We want to empower all New Yorkers
to act and prepare our city for a
clean and reliable energy future. To
achieve this ambitious goal, we must
succeed in both practice and policy
and foster a collaborative effort
across City agencies, community
leaders, and local businesses.
The City will take the first steps
electrifying City-owned and -operated
buildings while simultaneously
enabling residential, commercial,
and industrial electrification. We
must improve efficiency to make
electrification affordable and
accessible. We plan to advance
electrification with policy reforms,
funding, and implementation support.

 Implement HPD design
guidelines to address energy
efficiency, sustainability, and

HPD will be investing in energy
retrofits through its recently
published Design Guidelines for
Preservation. HPD has committed
to strategically electrifying up to
12,000 units of existing affordable
housing through 2026 and to
requiring building electrification and
flood resilient construction for all
new construction projects.159 The
HPD design guidelines will require
screening for current and future
flood and heat risk and establish
mandatory standards for efficiency,
health, and resilience. Leveraging
Inflation Reduction Act rebates
and other incentives, the City will
continue to implement HPD’s Design
Guidelines for Preservation.

and reduce carbon emissions in
New York City.152 The expanded NYC
Accelerator will build on the success
of the current program by expanding
resources beyond buildings that fall
under Local Law 97, such as smaller
buildings and industrial facilities, and
incorporating a wider suite of climate
sustainability and resilience information.
NYC Accelerator will empower
stakeholders to better understand

and access technical guidelines.
with 100% renewable energy sources,
meaning less pollution and fewer GHG
emissions. By 2027, the City, NYCHA,
NYSERDA, and the New York Power
Authority (NYPA) will fund and install
30,000 packaged heat pumps for
10,000 NYCHA apartments through the
recognized Clean Heat for All design
challenge, resulting in improved control
and comfort for residents and greater
resilience to extreme heat. Reaching
100% residential cooling will help
save lives. In August 2022, NYCHA, in
coordination with NYPA and NYSERDA,
announced the manufacturers selected
for the Clean Heat for All design
challenge, a competition to design an
air-source heat pump that can be easily
and affordably installed in a window
frame.158 The design will pave the way
for the electrification of multifamily
buildings citywide.
Where feasible, investments in
heat pumps will be coupled with
deep building envelope retrofits
that maximize energy efficiency
and resilience, including window
replacements to cover weatherization
benefits to buildings and residents.
These investments in heat pumps
will reduce NYCHA’s energy demand,
improve local air quality, and replace
our aging heating infrastructure to
ensure that residents do not face
interruptions in heating in the winter.

In October 2022, New York City
launched the nation’s largest school
electrification effort, “Leading the
Charge,” the City’s most impactful
energy-saving initiative under Local
Law 97, which sets limits on GHG
emissions that buildings must
adhere to starting in 2024.161 The
construction of new City schools
will be all-electric, and the City will
complete or initiate the conversion
of 100 existing schools to allelectric heating by 2030.162
The City will eliminate the use
of highly polluting No. 4 heating
oil by 2025 by converting more
than 200 schools to ultra-low
sulfur biofuel—an interim step
towards electrification.163 This will
immediately improve neighborhood
air quality by reducing diseasecausing particulates from onsite
combustion by 99%.164 The City
will also install more efficient
LED lights in 800 schools by
2026 and support training and
development for the students who
will become the next generation
of the green workforce.165 The
program is expected to reduce
GHG emissions by 120,000
tons annually and remove more
than 20,000 pounds of harmful,
disease-causing fine particulates
from the air—the equivalent of
removing 26,000 cars from city
streets and avoiding nearly 100
respiratory incidents, saving lives
and reducing hospitalizations.166
Schools located in environmental
justice communities will be
prioritized for retrofits, ensuring
that we are tackling climate change
with a strong focus on equity and
community health.
The air we breathe can have a major
effect on our health; air pollution can
make asthma worse and cause heart
disease, lung disease, and strokes.167
Reducing emissions from specific
sources around the city is an important
function of the NYC Air Code and
related regulations enforced through
DEP. Air quality in NYC has been
improving over the past few decades
but, in addition to traffic and trucks,
buildings burning fossil fuels for
heating and charbroiling in restaurants
are major sources of emissions that
make some neighborhoods more
polluted than others.168 We know this
from the data collected by the New
York City Community Air Survey, a
previous PlaNYC initiative and the
largest ongoing urban air monitoring
program of any U.S. city.169 Since 2008,
New York City Community Air Survey
monitors have been permanently
located throughout the city to track
changes in neighborhood pollution
levels over time.

To understand sub-neighborhood scale
impacts and inform enforcement of the
existing Air Code, DEP is developing
a localized point source monitoring
program. The program will provide
unique insights into air quality from
local sources in sensitive communities,
which will inform regulatory strategy
and enable residents to understand
their air quality and how they can help
solve local air pollution problems.
 Develop a new air quality
monitoring program by 2024
Residents are often concerned
about sources of air pollution in their
neighborhoods. The New York City
Community Air Survey tracks changes
over time in NYC neighborhoods, but
was not designed to detect impacts
from a specific factory, construction
site, or building. DEP is developing a
responsive, adjustable air monitoring
program to assess localized
impacts and improve regulations
and rules. The goal of the program
is to address community concerns
by identifying emissions sources
regulated by the Air Code and by
informing enforcement actions.
This monitoring program will provide
insight into effective mitigation efforts
to address hyper-local sources and
protect vulnerable populations in
disadvantaged communities. By
identifying pollution hotspots and
directing solutions that solve local
air pollution problems, the program
will help drive additional controls and
According to C40 Cities, 23% of
global GHG emissions come from
the construction of buildings and
infrastructure.170 The fossil fuel-fired
construction equipment we use not
only emits GHGs, but also creates air
and noise pollution. NYC can address
these problems with proven solutions,
and show leadership by developing and
bolstering the green economy. When

 Phase out City capital
spending on fossil fuel
equipment and infrastructure
Eliminating emissions associated
with fossil fuels is critical to meeting
the City’s public health goals and
GHG reduction targets. When paired
with renewable energy, converting
to all-electric equipment significantly
reduces emissions and decreases
energy costs. Furthermore,
equipment electrification improves
both indoor and outdoor air quality.
To reduce reliance on fossil fuels in
City-owned and operated buildings,
we will phase out capital spending
on new fossil fuel equipment and
obsolete infrastructure and consider
appropriate uses for biogenic
fuels, or fuels derived from organic
matter.160 The City will begin with
feasible replacements in 2025.
Phasing out capital spending on
fossil fuel heating and cooling
systems and equipment will send a
strong signal to NYC’s design and
construction markets that they must
prepare for a rapid transition to allelectric appliances and equipment.
“Leading the Charge”
CITY LEADING BY EXAMPLE
The embodied carbon in building products can vary significantly based on the raw material extraction, production process, distribution network, and
manufacturing energy profile of the product. These differences result in varying levels of CO2 emissions on a per unit basis for construction materials, as
shown in the above infographic. Using materials with lower embodied carbon is key to reducing the carbon footprint of the construction industry.

The City is committed to reducing
embodied carbon emissions for
new buildings, infrastructure,
and major retrofits by 50%. This
ambitious target will be realized
through the use of a reporting
framework, low-embodied carbon
materials, green building practices,
and incorporation of innovative
material and technological solutions
as they become readily available.
There is considerable momentum
toward environmentally sustainable
practices in the construction industry
that will reduce waste and carbon.
At the same time, the Infrastructure
Investment and Jobs Act and the
Inflation Reduction Act will drive new
development in the city while making
resources available to promote
low-carbon solutions. The City will
seize this moment to ensure that
major construction activities drive the
adoption of new sustainable methods
to reduce GHG emissions and
air pollution.172, 173
 Implement performancebased standards for
low-carbon materials and
equipment by 2025
The City will develop a policy pathway
to regulate the embodied carbon
content of building materials through
the NYC Building Code. This policy
will establish low-embodied carbon
specifications for common building
materials such as concrete, which
alone contributes 8% of total
global GHG emissions.174 Architects
and engineers are exploring new
materials and methods of clean,
sustainable construction. The
City will support this innovation by
connecting industry with existing
grants to explore low-carbon
construction materials and
methods. For example, the City
will incentivize the use of mass
timber in construction through
grants provided by the U.S. Forest
Service’s Wood Innovations Program,
Softwood Lumber Board, and
matched funds from NYCEDC.
Although leading construction
equipment manufacturers recognize
the need for all-electric construction
equipment, the market is still
nascent. In partnership with Federal
and State agencies, the City can
play a role in driving the uptake of
electric construction machinery
by signaling demand. The City will
also engage with stakeholders and
drive research on the use of lowcarbon materials and methods. For
example, ground glass pozzolan,
In September 2022, Mayor
Adams signed a landmark
Executive Order for City capital
project agencies and positioned
New York City as a leader in clean
construction. Clean Construction
Executive Order 23 requires the
City’s capital project agencies to
commit to actions that will lower
embodied carbon from municipal
construction projects.177
Executive Order 23 directs
agencies to do the following:
• Set specifications for lowembodied carbon concrete for
use in capital projects to directly
reduce the environmental
impact of construction
• Submit environmental product
declarations for structural steel
and concrete to quantify the
environmental impact of these
materials in City projects
• Include specifications in capital
project construction contracts
for low-emission vehicles and
equipment, with a preference
for all-electric equipment to
reduce air and noise pollution
which is made from recycled
post-consumer glass, can replace
up to 50% of cement in concrete,
dramatically reducing embodied
carbon emissions.175 Partnering
with NYCEDC and the Battery Park
Coastal Resilience projects, the City
will study ground glass pozzolan in
marine applications to enable industry
professionals to gain experience
with these materials and potentially
incorporate them into large coastal
infrastructure projects.
 Expand ConstructNYC in 2023
The ConstructNYC program connects
small-to-mid-sized Minority, Women,
and otherwise Disadvantaged
Business Enterprises with exclusive
opportunities to work on NYCEDC
projects through contracts of up to
$3 million.176 In 2023, the City will
re-launch an expanded ConstructNYC
program to add new green skills
trainings and prepare businesses
to meet the moment, including
instruction in building retrofits and
practices that reduce embodied
carbon, like deconstruction (as
opposed to demolition), materials
selection, and sourcing.
• Complete a Life Cycle

In addition to achieving GHG
emissions reductions, Executive
Order 23 will reduce air and noise
pollution and drive the industry-wide
use of new construction technologies
and materials. The City also plans
to build upon Executive Order 23 to
incorporate low-embodied carbon
specification requirements for other
building materials beyond concrete
and steel, such as insulation and glass.

CLEAN & RELIABLE
ENERGY
Energy powers all aspects of life
in NYC: the fans and heaters in our
homes, the lights in our schools,
cell phones, computers, and our
cars, buses, and trains. New Yorkers
use electricity, steam, and gas
brought to buildings through on-site
infrastructure as well as fuel oils
delivered from regional sources.
In addition to electricity generated
upstate and delivered to the City via
the statewide transmission system,
NYC is home to 24 in-city fossil
fuel power plants and small-scale
distributed energy resources.178
But all forms of energy are not
equal, and the ways we generate
and procure electricity matter. Our
energy system can be extractive, an
accelerator of climate change, the
cause of disproportionate and harmful
environmental and community impacts,
and a financial and physical burden.
Alternatively, it can be clean, reliable,
and equitable for all.
The City is committed to achieving
a clean energy future. PlaNYC
(2007) set our goal for cleaner,
more reliable power for every New
Yorker and the Roadmap to 80 x 50
(2016) articulated the vision for this
transformation.179 Since 2007, we have
made significant progress across
the city and state. In NYC, there are
388 megawatts of solar installed
as of 2023, with 43 megawatts of
community solar installed and 83
megawatts in development.180 We
have also made significant strides
in bringing large-scale renewable
energy to the city. In November
2022, construction began on the
Champlain Hudson Power Express
(CHPE) transmission line to source
clean hydropower from Canada. We
have been fostering the growth of the
offshore wind sector to help the State
meet its goal of 9,000 megawatts
of offshore wind energy by 2035.181
Yet, we have more to accomplish
to reach our clean energy goals.
Our current energy supply relies on
fossil fuels and aging infrastructure
and results in some of the highest
energy costs in the nation. More than
80% of our electricity today comes
from burning oil and gas, releasing
GHG emissions and air pollution that
contributes to climate change, as well
as chronic health conditions such as
asthma and heart disease.182 New
Yorkers rely on some of the oldest
energy transmission and generation
infrastructure in the country. Our peak
energy demand is met by local fossil
fuel power plants, many of which are
reaching the end of their operational
life. This leaves residents vulnerable
to increased risk of power outages
as equipment is damaged or needs to
be taken offline for repairs. NYC has
some of the most expensive energy
rates in the country. High energy
costs have significant economic and
health consequences for low-income
families, including stress, mental health
impacts, and worsening respiratory
conditions. In 2016, New York State
set a target that low-income residents
should pay no more than 6% of their
income toward energy bills; however,
despite this policy goal, more than
460,000 low-income families in NYC
are still spending more than 6% of
their pre-tax income on energy bills.183
As the effects of climate change
grow increasingly dangerous with
record-breaking heat waves and more
intense storms like Hurricane Ida, our
call to action is clear: we must reduce
reliance on fossil fuels and transition
to clean, renewable energy. Our plan
will leverage City-owned properties,
support home decarbonization efforts,
especially for low-to-moderate
income homeowners, and strengthen
our partnership with the State in
achieving the goals of the landmark
Climate Leadership and Community
Protection Act. Through the
Climate Leadership and Community
Protection Act, the State commits to
delivering 70% renewable electricity
by 2030 and a zero-emissions
electric grid by 2040.184 The City will
do its part to ensure a clean, reliable,
and equitable energy future for all
New Yorkers.
OUR PLAN
To achieve a clean energy future
in a way that prioritizes our most
vulnerable communities, we must
take a multi-pronged approach.
In May 2023, the City will be
sharing the results of PowerUp, a
year-long collaborative study with
community leaders, energy experts,
and residents, to identify specific
near-term actions that the City will
take to meet long-term energy and
equity goals. PowerUp will lay out
the obstacles, opportunities, and
implementation steps for several
key initiatives that address the
increased energy burdens from
building electrification, accelerating
the retirement of fossil fuel power
plants, increasing solar and battery
storage on City land, and eliminating
energy insecurity. As a complement
to PowerUp, this plan focuses on
three key initiatives. The first is to
install solar, battery storage, or green
roofs on all City-owned property,
leveraging our own resources and
demonstrating City leadership.
The second is to support the State’s
clean energy transition in facilitating
transmission infrastructure and
offshore wind development. The
third is to provide end-to-end
support for low-to-moderate income
homeowners and environmental
justice communities to install solar
energy and decarbonize homes.
Maximize climate infrastructure

solar arrays, battery storage, systems
for building electrification, and other
renewable energy infrastructure on
City-owned properties will reduce

infrastructure, such as installing
solar canopies above green

Specifically, the City will investigate
opportunities to site energy
storage on our properties.
Additional investment in energy
storage capacity is necessary
to support and store renewable
energy such as solar and wind. By
enhancing existing and new solar
arrays with energy storage, the
City can increase grid reliability
and resilience in environmental
justice communities, which are
particularly susceptible to climaterelated power-loss events.

supporting access to solar and
full-building decarbonization for
one- to four-family buildings and lowincome residents in disadvantaged
communities, and exploring
other underutilized rooftops for
shared ownership and savings
models. Historically, low-income
residents and environmental justice
communities have been excluded
from the clean energy economy and
cannot afford the upfront costs of
installing rooftop solar, heat pumps,
or other energy efficiency retrofits.
The Public Solar initiative aims to
help overcome these cost barriers.
Public Solar will provide 3,000
homes over the next five years with
proactive door-to-door outreach
and financial assistance for rooftop
solar. To support this program, the
City will work with New York City

include providing income eligible
buildings with grants, bridge loans,

rooftop solar, and an innovative public
option in which a City-affiliated entity
would directly install and own the solar,
sharing the benefits with residents.
Recognizing the pressures of
gentrification, displacement, and
inflation, Public Solar goes beyond
clean energy investments and is a
major strategy to help keep lowincome residents in their homes.
Low-income homes in historically

on energy investment and
production projects, the City
is now eligible for direct
payments from the Federal

for domestic violence survivors, and I am a single mother of
three kids. It made sense.
Climate change is happening. I came to New York from Haiti
and Florida, and I was used to hurricanes. When I first came
to New York they didn’t happen that often. Now we’ve had
Hurricane Sandy and Hurricane Ida. My home was very cold
on the lower level. The first improvement was insulation. It
got warmer faster and stayed warmer longer. I also had a big
leak and a hole in my ceiling and the contractors fixed it.
The second improvement was solar, but before I got the
panels, I had to get a new roof. I spent about 12% of my

modernize the Zoning Resolution
to allow for retrofitting of buildings,
transforming our electric grid,
improving the City’s waste
streams, and supporting the

the City Council in Fall 2023.
These zoning changes are
critical to expanding energy
retrofit opportunities for more
than 50,000 older buildings built
before current zoning rules were
put in place.197 Our city’s rooftops
could be generating enough

district in the city. The proposal
will also more than double the

GREEN SPACE
However, these spaces have been
historically underfunded and parks
in environmental justice communities
are in need of additional care and
activation. We can improve access to
these hidden gems and encourage
stewardship to help with upkeep.
Since the release of NYC’s first
comprehensive sustainability plan,
PlaNYC (2007), the City has added
more than 1,000 acres of new
parkland, created 12 miles of open
space along the waterfront, restored
more than 550 acres of natural areas,
planted more than 850,000 native
plants, and formalized more than
200 miles of nature trails traversing
diverse landscapes.204 We also
know more about the conditions of
our natural areas and trail systems,
which is important data for improving
access. Through actions like the
Community Parks Initiative, we have
reconnected New Yorkers with
existing green spaces by improving
smaller neighborhood parks in
communities with the greatest need.
Our plan will continue to improve
access to parks and open spaces in
under-resourced neighborhoods and
invest in our natural areas so they can
thrive and provide maximum climate
benefits to our city.
OUR PLAN
Our focus now is to ensure that all
New Yorkers can benefit from our open
space network and that it can be used
to respond to the increasing climate
hazards our city is facing. Through
our greenway commitments, including
those outlined in the City’s Destination
Greenways plan, we will create more
than 10 acres of new open space and
safe connections between parks.205 We
will formalize and improve 300 miles
of trails, many of which are in our outer
borough parks like Van Cortlandt in
the Bronx or Forest Park in Queens.
By planting 30,000 native trees and
shrubs across 10 sites, we will restore
the health of forested areas, which
contributes to reduced flooding and
higher quality soil, water, and air. This
effort, combined with maintenance
of existing trees and the formation
of public-private partnerships to
encourage tree planting on private land,
will also support our goal to achieve a
30% tree canopy cover and cool our
public realm (see Extreme Heat). The
City will also continue to look for ways
to increase the number of New Yorkers
that live within a 10-minute walk of a
park by creating new green spaces
where possible. Together, these actions
will improve the quality of life for all New
Yorkers while responding and adapting
to climate change.

from increasing heat waves,
improving the air we breathe, and
capturing and filtering rainwater. We
have more green space citywide
than ever before. More than 30,000

natural areas capture and absorb rain
water, acting as natural stormwater
retention systems.213 They also store
more carbon and provide greater
cooling potential than other types
of urban vegetation. Trees remove
dust and pollutants from the air
which improves public health and
supports active living. Forests lower
summer outdoor temperatures by
shading buildings, cooling streets,
and reducing our reliance on fossil
fuels to cool and heat homes and
businesses. In addition to improving
the health of our forested areas, we
are taking a number of actions to
increase the city’s tree canopy (see
Extreme Heat).
 Restore and steward 1,000
acres of forests across 10 sites,
planting more than 30,000
native trees and shrubs
Forested areas in NYC comprise
approximately 28% of the total tree
canopy.214 Restoring and preserving
shrubs. And beginning last year, the
Natural Areas Conservancy began
providing training support, vegetation
management, and trail improvement
projects across Seton Falls Park,
with funding from the Long Island
Sound Futures Fund to train and
deploy community stewards in caring
for natural resources in their park.
After five years of monitoring,
protected populations of the
American strawberry bush grew
more vigorously compared to
unprotected populations.218 Similarly
protected populations of the Turk’s
cap lily flourished while unprotected
populations were stunted or not
visible.219 The fenced Turk’s cap lily
finally bloomed for the first time after
five years of fencing protection—a
literal and figurative bright spot
for a plant that has been failing to
reproduce in Staten Island for several
years because of overgrazing.220
Results from monitoring suggest
that expanding fencing to protect
other populations is a viable
strategy to support the recovery
of these rare plant populations.

our forested areas is critical to
expanding our tree canopy. Planting
30,000 trees and shrubs in our forests
will result in capturing more carbon
dioxide from the atmosphere and
releasing oxygen in exchange.
An example of how forest restoration
can truly transform local communities
is Seton Falls Park in the Bronx.
Beginning in winter 2024, NYC Parks
will remove invasive species across
over 20 acres of degraded forested
natural area in the eastern half of
the park and plant more than 5,000
native plants. Over the last five years,
the park has already undergone
significant transformation. Since April
2018, NYC Parks’ Stewardship team
has led more than 400 community
volunteers in over 1,200 hours of
service via the Green Neighborhoods
program to remove debris and
non-native species in preparation
for native planting. Since then,
community groups, like the Seton Falls

WATERWAYS
The LTCP for Jamaica Bay and its
tributaries presents an innovative
approach to water quality
improvements that emphasizes
the use of nature-based solutions
to preserve the ecosystem’s
biodiversity.226 While the Jamaica
Bay watershed is highly urbanized,
it also supports a range of diverse
habitats, including estuarine open
water, intertidal zones, salt marsh
islands, fringing salt marshes, tidal
mud and sand flats, and freshwater
wetlands, ponds, and tributaries.
It is home to more than 325 bird
species, 100 species of fish, and 50
species of moths and butterflies.227
Recognizing the value of this
critical ecological resource, the
Jamaica Bay LTCP incorporates
a range of strategies that work
together to improve water quality
and enhance ecosystem health in
Jamaica Bay. This large-scale green
infrastructure implementation at the
watershed level includes strategies
such as vegetated swales, rain
gardens, and infiltration basins to
capture and treat stormwater runoff
before it enters the bay. The plan
also includes the restoration of at
least 50 acres of wetlands, seven
acres of ribbed mussel colonies, and
environmental dredging.228 This
world-class, innovative approach
to water quality improvements is
expected to provide co-benefits such
as carbon sequestration, air quality
improvements, and a reduction in
the urban heat island effect.
Reduce combined sewer
overflows by more than 4 billion
gallons per year by 2045 to
improve water quality:
• Deliver the Long-Term Control
Plans by 2045
• Expand the implementation of
the NYC Green Infrastructure
Program, the largest of
its kind in the nation
• Capture stormwater at the
source through the Unified
Stormwater Rule
Develop a strategy to end
the discharge of untreated
sewage into the New
York Harbor by 2060.
Improve the health and
ecological function of wetlands:
• Restore wetlands for flood risk
reduction, conservation, and
open space benefits
New York Harbor is a tremendous
asset to all New Yorkers. Since the
1980s, the City has invested more
than $45 billion in wastewater systems
that have made our waterways
cleaner than they have been in
more than a century—which is why
whales, dolphins, and other marine
life are back in our harbor.221 These
investments have also facilitated
the expansion of waterfront open
spaces, commercial and residential
development, greenways, citywide
ferry service, and increased goods
movement by water. A healthier harbor
has made the waterfront one
of NYC’s most attractive features.
Resource Recovery Facilities, as
well as efforts to prevent stormwater
from ever reaching the sewers.
These efforts include increased
stormwater storage capacity and
a bold, broad effort to construct
nearly 13,000 rain gardens and other
types of green infrastructure to
capture rainwater at the source.224
We have also successfully launched
several wetland restoration and
creation programs and installed
ribbed mussels in Bergen and
Thurston Basin in Jamaica Bay as
an ecological filtering mechanism to
improve water quality.225
While we have made vast progress,
our plan will further reduce annual
CSOs by more than 4 billion gallons.
The City has agreed upon a set of
Long-Term Control Plans (LTCPs)
with the State of New York that chart
out our legally mandated efforts to
continue to reduce CSOs. Due to
their scope and size, the LTCPs will
cost more than $6 billion and take
until around 2045 to complete. In
parallel, we will achieve further CSO
reduction by expanding the proven
Green Infrastructure Program.
But there is more that we can and
should do—it is time to plan for a city
without combined sewer overflows in
all but the most extreme storms.
OUR WATERWAYS GOAL
We will improve the
health and ecological
function of NYC’s
waterways.
OUR PLAN
Despite the progress we have made,
more work is needed to improve the
health of our waterways and all the
incredible ecological functions they
serve. First, we have committed to
our next generation of harbor water
quality improvements and CSO
reductions through projects laid
out in the LTCPs. Over the next few
years, we will craft an integrated
strategy that further drives down
CSOs and achieves applicable water
quality standards in the harbor
by 2060. We will also continue to
restore and preserve our city’s
wetlands, which not only provide
immense long-term water quality and
ecosystem benefits that allow our
harbors to thrive but also protect our
coastline by reducing storm surge
and mitigating coastal erosion.

Significant improvements in our
wastewater treatment processes,
especially the reduction of combined
sewer overflows (CSOs), are core
to the water quality improvements
we have seen in recent decades.
NYC’s combined sewer system
can be overwhelmed during heavy
rainfall, when a mix of stormwater and
untreated sewage may be discharged
directly into the city’s waterways
(known as a CSO). Prior to 1990, more
than 100 billion gallons of CSOs were
released annually;222 by 2022, annual
CSO discharges had been reduced by
approximately 85%.223 This is the result

DEP will continue to implement
the largest green infrastructure

reducing 1.67 billion gallons in CSOs
per year. In addition to the nearly
13,000 green infrastructure assets
built, we will continue to expand our
program to the Bronx and Brooklyn
with 300,000 feet of porous
ten waterbody-specific and one
citywide—to reduce CSO events
by 2.5 billion gallons a year and
achieve waterbody-specific water
quality standards.229 These plans are
comprehensive, watershed-based
approaches that address the impacts
of CSOs on water quality in the New
York Harbor and its tributaries.
Together, these 11 plans call
for an investment of more than
$6 billion to construct both
traditional gray infrastructure and
nature-based solutions. Specific
projects include the following: • Daylighting Tibbetts Brook, a
$133 million project that will
begin construction in 2025 and
reduce CSOs by 220 million

know that there will still be CSOs with
significant rainfall. We will develop a
strategy that layers onto existing LTCP
requirements, integrates the municipal

the release of untreated CSOs and
polluted stormwater before it enters
our waterways, improving water quality
and the health of marine ecosystems.
However, the city’s physical space
constraints, topography, geology,

extreme storms could continue
to overwhelm even the largest
investments in the stormwater system.

COMBINED SEWER SYSTEM IN DRY AND WET WEATHER CONDITIONS
The City is expanding its green infrastructure
program, adding to the portfolio of nearly
13,000 rain gardens and other green features
that absorb stormwater.
A typical combined sewer system collects stormwater runoff, domestic sewage, and wastewater. The system then transports collected flows into a
wastewater resource recovery facility. During heavy rainstorms, combined sewers receive higher than normal flows. Recovery facilities are unable to
handle flows that are more than twice the design capacity. This may result in a combined sewer overflow (CSO), or a mix of stormwater and untreated
sewage that discharges directly into the city’s waterways.

19
Wetlands absorb floodwaters during
storm events, capture carbon, and
enhance biodiversity. But the city’s
tidal marshes—nature’s buffer that
protects coastal communities from
storm-induced flood loss—are at risk.
Centuries ago there were over 30,000
acres of salt marshes in NYC.237 Today
there are just 4,000 acres, less than
15% of their historical extent.238 Sea
level rise and increasingly extreme
and frequent storms are contributing
to marsh loss. Marshes are unable
to effectively adapt to sea level
rise and migrate because most
land within New York City is filled,
hardened, and highly urbanized.  Restore wetlands for flood risk
reduction, conservation, and
open space benefits
Marshes are our most abundant
and visible wetlands and a first line
of defense again coastal storms.
However, some of the city’s salt
marshes have been in decline due to
sea level rise inundation and other
interactions with the urban ecosystem.
We will increase our understanding
of coastal wetlands by analyzing
salt marsh loss, and we will expand
protection and restoration of these
marshes by advancing techniques
such as the addition of thin layers of
sediment. Building up marsh elevations
by adding sediment increases
resilience to sea level rise and reduces
the risk of marsh drowning. We will
also work with partners to advance
the use of natural and nature-based
solutions in coastal resilience
projects. To ensure no net loss of
wetlands and to facilitate permitting
of critical infrastructure projects
along our waterfronts, we will engage
environmental regulators and expand
our strategies for wetland mitigation.
“Growing up on Jamaica Bay, my dad taught me how to
fish and crab at a young age. Flooding is a big topic in my
community. We were hit by Irene, Sandy, and Winter Storm
Elliott. We lost cars.
I want to make a difference in the environment. This program
is trying to create long-term positions in wetlands. Today we
did a beach cleanup and have been learning about animals
and plants that are in the area. We have very old creatures that
are called horseshoe crabs. There are more than a hundred
kinds of fish in Jamaica Bay.
Climate change is damaging the natural environment.
Everything used to be healthy and there was a lot of
marshland and wetland, but they are deteriorating. We’re
working to build up Jamaica Bay and restore plant life.
This program is about climate action. Without people helping
the environment it’s going to keep deteriorating. Maintained
marshlands are beneficial to shoreline communities because
they break down the harshness of the storms—the winds,
impact, and waves.
I can’t imagine my life without water. We ate the fish we
caught. I learned jet skiing, boating, and swimming. Water
taught me how to survive.”

TRANSPORTATION
Transportation is key to our quality
of life and unlocks economic
opportunities—jobs, education,
healthcare, and civic life. NYC has the
highest sustainable mode share of any
major U.S. city—as of fall 2022, 65%
of trips were made by walking, transit,
and biking.240 Through the NYC Streets
Plan,241 we have promoted increased
walking, biking, and transit, and through
our Vision Zero Action Plans we have
endeavored to make mobility safe for
all.242 Our sustainable transportation
future will be determined by land use
and density. We are reinvigorating our
mass transit and walking-dependent
business districts via the Making
New York Work for Everyone, along
with our commitment to 500,000
new housing units that will further
support equitable and sustainable
housing development.243 These
investments to further support the
growth of our population, businesses,
and jobs are at the core of our
sustainability agenda and will lead to
increased mobility across the city.
Our transportation investments will
continue to build on the progress of
the last 16 years to make our streets
safer and more bike friendly, increase
bus ridership, and reduce truck-related
pollution. To date, we have redesigned
more than 1,000 lane miles of streets
and 16,000 intersections, decreasing
pedestrian fatalities by more than
50% since the mid-1990s.244 Our
bike lane network has grown from
approximately 600 lane miles in 2007
to 1,500 in 2022.245 During this same
timeframe, NYC has built the largest
bike share system in North America.246
With our MTA partners, we have also
dramatically expanded priority lanes
for buses, installing 105 miles of bus
lanes. Our Clean Trucks Program,247

the Chief Public Realm Officer
• Implement our ambitious bike,
the negative impacts of Robert
Moses-era highways, like the Cross
Bronx Expressway and the Brooklyn
Queens Expressway, which have
divided communities for far too long.
Although we have made significant
progress, the City will need to make
further strides to meet our ambitious
goal of net-zero transportation GHG
emissions by 2050. To achieve this,
we must advance two transitions
simultaneously. First, we will find
new ways to encourage more New
Yorkers to choose walking, biking,
and transit instead of driving so we
can achieve a sustainable mode share
of 80% by 2050. Second, we will
aim to transition the remaining
automobile trips to electric vehicles
(EVs). This includes transforming
our goods distribution system from
primary reliance on heavy-duty
diesel trucks to electric trucks, cargo
e-bikes, rail, and waterborne transport.
The Central Business District Tolling
Program, the first congestion pricing
program in the United States,
started as an initiative in the first
PlaNYC (2007) and remains the
most important step toward shifting
trips to sustainable modes.250 The
City will continue to partner with the
MTA in making buses better via the
bus network redesigns, bus priority
projects, and ensuring public safety
in the subway system. The City will
improve the pedestrian experience
by reinventing our public space under
the leadership of our first-ever Chief
Public Realm Officer.
Lastly, we will encourage those
who need to drive to choose
electric vehicles (EVs). As we shift
passengers to sustainable modes and
EVs, we must do the same for freight
with equal urgency. Heavy-duty diesel
trucks are responsible for nearly half
of all on-road tailpipe pollution in NYC
and are key contributors to poor air
quality.251 The exhaust from diesel
engines contains fine particulate
matter (PM2.5), which is linked to
acute and chronic health conditions.
PM2.5 is responsible for 63% of
deaths caused by the environment in
the United States and has been linked
to increased hospital admissions for
heart and lung diseases, bronchitis,
and worsening of asthma and chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease.252
As freight traffic increases, we must
take steps to protect our air quality
and improve health outcomes for our
most vulnerable communities.
By reducing the number of polluting
vehicles on the road as much as
possible and investing in cleaner
transportation alternatives like transit,
walking, biking, and EVs, we will
make our city more sustainable and
healthier. We envision a city where all
New Yorkers have access to reliable,
affordable, and environmentally
friendly transportation options.

TRANSPORTATION
Get polluting
trucks off
NYC streets
20
Currently, 90% of goods destined
for the five boroughs are
transported by truck, and almost all
of the trucks are diesel-powered.253
The resulting air pollution impacts
local health and exacerbates the
global climate crisis. Our reliance
on diesel trucks disproportionately
burdens low-income communities
of color adjacent to the city’s
industrial areas, which are now
home to a growing concentration
of last-mile delivery facilities.
 Pilot the East Coast’s first
low-emission zone centered on
environmental justice through
incentives and other methods
Other global cities, such as London,
have used low-emission zones to
catalyze shifts to sustainable modes
and EVs. The City will explore ways
to incentivize the use of low- and
low/zero-emission trucks through
the piloting of low-emission freight
zones in areas with the highest
concentration of truck traffic and
the worst public health outcomes.
The City will study a range of pricing,
regulatory, and incentive options,
and pilot a program to benefit
one or more environmental justice
communities by 2027.
 End unlawful truck idling
Truck idling leads to heavy
air pollution that is often
concentrated in environmental
justice communities. NYC has the
largest resident idling complaint
program in the United States,
and the only program that offers
monetary incentivizes for reporting
idling.254 While the program has
grown significantly, many large
fleets continue to idle repeatedly.
By 2024, we will implement a
series of reforms to continue
to increase participation and
electric charging depots for trucks
and other medium-duty vehicles,
accessible to any company. These
charging depots will be developed
through public-private partnerships.
They will be strategically located
next to truck routes and in areas
such as Industrial Business
Zones and existing freight hubs,
with a goal of the first hubs
being operational by 2030.
 Accelerate adoption of cargo
bikes for deliveries by 2026
To transition local truck deliveries
to the cleanest and most efficient
technologies, the City will promote
commercial cargo bikes for lastmile deliveries. Cargo bikes are an
effective mode for last-mile goods
delivery in NYC, and the number of
cargo bike deliveries has increased
dramatically since the launch of
the Cargo Bike Pilot Program in
2019. In January 2021 alone, there
were more than 45,000 cargo
bike deliveries.255 Building on the
success of the existing program,
we will seek Federal funding to
create an incentive program for
businesses to purchase cargo
e-bikes and work with our City and
State legislative partners to remove
unnecessary barriers to deployment
of commercial cargo e-bikes in NYC.
These initiatives will help us meet a
goal of growing participation in the
NYC Department of Transportation
(DOT) Commercial Cargo Bike
program from 350 bikes in 2020 to
2,500 bikes by 2026.
 Reactivate the marine highway
by 2025 to move freight off
trucks and onto water
Many docks in NYC lack the docking
infrastructure to enable freight
movement by marine vessels. To
address this challenge, by 2025,
NYCEDC will activate six waterfront
sites in Brooklyn, Manhattan, and the
Bronx to create opportunities for a
marine freight distribution network.
This will catalyze the movement of
freight away from trucks on crowded
highways and streets to waterways,
and facilitate the use of sustainable
last-mile vehicles to get goods from
dock to door.

TRANSPORTATION
More than anywhere in the United
States, New York City is a city of
pedestrians, transit riders, and
increasingly, cyclists. Our community
gathers, moves, and plays on our
streets and in our parks, public plazas,
and other shared spaces. The City will
continue to prioritize investments that
support transit, walking, cycling, and
vibrant public spaces, as these are
central to our quality of life, economic
vitality, and sustainable future.
 Bring New Yorkers back to the
transit system to achieve a
sustainable mode share of 80%
by 2050
New York’s subways, buses, and
railroads will play a critical role in
through increased pedestrian
safety redesigns, bike lanes, and
other infrastructure upgrades.
Equity and accessibility are guiding
principles for this work, with
investments focused on historically
underserved neighborhoods and
populations. A key component of
all projects is public engagement,
which provides the benefits of
local knowledge and input.
 Increase sidewalk
cleanliness by expanding
waste containerization
In the wake of the COVID-19
pandemic, there is a growing need
to create cityscapes that bring
back businesses and residents.
Both visible waste reduction on
streets and reduced sanitation
truck traffic have the potential to
reshape our shared city spaces.
By enhancing cleanliness, sidewalk
space, air quality, and pedestrianfocused navigability, we can attract
businesses and residents alike.
While cities in Europe, Asia, and
South America have introduced
innovations in waste collection over
the past two decades, New York
City remains stuck in the past. Bags
of trash sit on the curb awaiting
collection, obstructing sidewalks,
creating eyesores, and attracting
rodents. Newly implemented
operational changes to collect
more waste earlier in the day have
made meaningful improvements,
but we can go a step further.
Last fall, the NYC Department of
Sanitation (DSNY) launched a study
of containerization practices and
feasibility in New York City. This
study will be released in spring 2023
and will highlight the challenges and
opportunities for moving our waste to
individual bins and shared on-street
containers. DSNY will also build upon
recent pilots of Clean Curbs containers
in all five boroughs, testing new
models of containerization at larger
scales and in more neighborhoods,
while building out a plan for expanded
waste containerization initiatives.

a powerful incentive for drivers to
switch to transit, walking, or biking,
while also providing essential revenue
to fund the modernization of the
regional transit system. The program
also presents a once-in-a-generation
opportunity to accelerate cleaning our
air through the adoption of lowor zero-emission trucks. The City
will advocate for congestion pricing
implementation to incentivize zeroemission trucks, improved air quality
in environmental justice communities,
affordable access for low-income
New Yorkers without transit options,
and fair treatment for NYC taxis.

Ensure every New
Yorker can access
a bike or scooter
22
We are committed to increasing
mobility for all New Yorkers, especially
those underserved by transit. Many
trips in NYC could be accomplished by
bike or scooter, but many New Yorkers
do not have secure storage space
for them. Others may be unable
to afford a new bike or scooter
or may feel unsafe riding. Shared
scooter and bike systems, increased
secure bike parking, and improved
cycling infrastructure can help
more New Yorkers adopt cycling.
We will expand opportunities for
New Yorkers to access bikes and
scooters safely and conveniently.  Create next generation bike
lanes and facilities so every
New Yorker can travel safely
and efficiently
New Yorkers continue to adopt
micromobility, including e-bikes,
cargo bikes, and standing
e-scooters in increasing numbers.
These devices offer a safe and
convenient way to travel through
the city. However, along with this
growth comes a greater demand
for space on the street, especially
since these vehicles—and
conventional bicycles—have
varying sizes, weights, and speeds.
To accommodate different users
safely and comfortably, the City
will develop and pilot different bike
treatments on busy bike routes.
These design updates may include
wider or multiple bike lanes, bike
lane passing zones, bike speed
signal timing progressions, bike
boulevards, improved curbside
policies to reduce double parking,
and added bike parking for different
uses. Pilots will begin in 2023, and
updated design guidelines will be
released by 2027.  Create thousands of secure
public bike parking spots,
starting in 2025
The City will solicit proposals for
vendors to pilot secure bike parking
facilities to support and encourage
cycling, including the use of e-bikes
and cargo bikes. Providing curbside
access to secure bike storage for
residents who lack access to bike
storage, including for oversized
models and e-bikes, will promote
more frequent use of bicycles for
all trips. The program will also
facilitate the use of cargo bikes for
greener last-mile deliveries, improve
first-mile connections to transit, and
provide safe overnight storage for
delivery workers.  Expand dockless e-scooter and
e-bike share systems
Dockless shared e-bikes and
e-scooters can complement the
Citi Bike system, the nation’s largest
bike share program. In 2021, NYC
piloted dockless shared e-scooters
in the East Bronx. Building on
this successful pilot, the City will
make this program permanent. In
November 2022, DOT released a
Request for Proposals (RFP) to
continue e-scooter share service
in the East Bronx when the current
pilot ends in August 2023.257 The
RFP also allows for the expansion
of micromobility services, including
e-scooter and e-bike share, in other
parts of NYC. The continued East
Bronx program will launch this
year, with the potential expansion
launching in 2024.

Our bike lane network spans 1,500 miles across the
five boroughs. Many of these lanes are protected
from vehicle traffic by a physical barrier (e.g., parking
spaces, curb, or raised median), allowing New Yorkers
to bike safely on some of the city’s busiest streets.

SAFE AND SUSTAINABLE STREETS
“I picked up biking seriously in 2011. My commute changed
drastically. When I drove to work in Queens, it took up to an
hour and a half each way. But when I switched to biking, it was
45 minutes.
Biking connected me to my borough more. I was riding around
and recognizing what the Bronx wasn’t getting in comparison
to other places. I learned about advocacy and community
boards. Cycling infrastructure has improved, but the Bronx is
still lagging behind the other boroughs.
The City’s Bike the Block event was held on the street that I
grew up on. It was the first time River Avenue had been shut
down to traffic. People of all ages were there to learn how to
cycle and enjoy food and live music with their neighbors.
Many people ride out of necessity because they live in areas
where transportation isn’t readily available. Ten years ago, I
was the only person in my circle who rode a bike. Now I know
more cyclists than non-cyclists. Folks come from different
places and have different lives. But if you’re on a group ride,
you’re together, whether you’re riding a beater or a two
thousand dollar bike. My mom and son both ride. My mom
always wanted a tricycle so she bought a red Schwinn tricycle
with twenty-six-inch wheels.”

Help New Yorkers
who must drive to

23
We will support New Yorkers in
making the transition to cleaner
alternative vehicles for when they do
need to drive. We have already seen
an upward trend of New York vehicle
owners transitioning to EVs, especially
as models at affordable price points
become increasingly available. We
are leading the way by electrifying
City-owned fleets, and will advance
New Yorkers’ adoption of EVs by
supporting development of citywide
strategic charging infrastructure.
In 2022, the Environmental
Protection Agency awarded
NYC school bus operators $18.5
million in rebate funds from
the Clean School Bus Rebate
Program to purchase 51 electric
school buses.264 This initiative,
alongside NYC School Bus
Umbrella Services’ (NYCSBUS)
Vehicle-to-Grid EV School Bus
Case Study, funded through
an $8 million grant from New
York State Energy Research and
Development Authority, will kick
off the electrification of the City’s
entire school bus fleet by 2035.265
To accelerate this electrification
through a lens of environmental
justice, NYCSBUS’s case
study will take place at the
Zerega Avenue Depot in the
Bronx, where the surrounding
community ranks in the 98th
percentile nationally for air
pollution caused by diesel
engines.266 Electric school buses
have zero tailpipe emissions,
meaning they offer clean and
healthy rides as well as quieter
streets. The Zerega Avenue Case
Study will also support training
for electric school bus operators
and mechanics to help build
NYC’s EV workforce. With
this investment, NYC will help
advance a burgeoning industry
for medium- and heavy-duty EVs.

 Ensure every New Yorker is no
more than 2.5 miles from an

hub by 2035
For New Yorkers with private
garages, high-speed Level 2
charging will be the most affordable
and convenient EV charging option.
However, about half of New Yorkers
park curbside.258 For this group to
adopt EVs, they need to know they
can access fast EV charging when
needed.
A low-emissions future means it
must be as easy to charge at the
nearest EV charging hub as it is to
fill up at a gas station. To promote
this access, the City will collaborate
with partners in the private sector,
Con Edison, and other stakeholders
to create a comprehensive network
of publicly-accessible fast charging
stations across the city. Large
clusters of chargers will be located
along major transportation corridors,
The Department of Transportation’s Delancey and Essex Municipal Parking Garage in the Lower East Side neighborhood of Manhattan offers
shared electric charging depots, promoting EV use. Source: Department of Transportation
in public parking facilities, and near
key destinations. This network
will reduce range anxiety, making
it convenient for New Yorkers
to quickly charge their EVs. The
growth in charging infrastructure will
also help to support the transition of
for-hire vehicle fleets to EVs since
taxi and for-hire vehicle drivers will
be able to travel around the city
knowing that they are never far from
a fast, reliable, and available charger.
 Mandate private parking
garages and lots to make
electric vehicle charging
available by 2030
Many New Yorkers would like to
adopt EVs, but their regular parking
spots are in garages that they do
not control; charging investments
are often controlled by building
management companies or parking
garage operators. A very small
share of these spaces provide EV
charging. The City will work with

HEALTH EQUITY
The City has made
unprecedented progress
transitioning its fleet to EVs.
In September 2022, the New
York City Department of
Citywide Administrative
Services (DCAS) reached its
2025 goal of replacing 4,000
fossil-fuel powered vehicles
with EVs — three years
ahead of schedule.267 The
transition to EVs improves
air quality, reduces GHG
emissions, and contributes to
cost savings on maintenance
and fuel for both the City and
taxpayers. In January 2023,
the administration announced
more than $10 million in
Federal grants to replace an
additional 925 fleet vehicles
with EVs and install 315 new
EV chargers across the city.268
DCAS will receive $6.2 million,
and the remainder will be
used by the New York City
Department of Sanitation.269
DCAS has ordered seven
electric garbage trucks, seven
all-electric sweepers, and
30 plug-in hybrid electric
sweepers. DCAS also operates
the largest EV charging
network in New York State,
with more than 1,500 charging
ports available to fleet units.270

car.259, 260 Vehicles licensed through
the Taxi & Limousine Commission
(TLC) make 250 million trips and
produce approximately 600,000
metric tons of carbon dioxide
a year—roughly 4% of citywide
transportation emissions.261 EV
adoption by TLC-licensed industries
would have a profound impact on
reducing NYC’s GHG emissions and
improving air quality.
The City will support electric vehicle
adoption of taxis and for-hire vehicles
in several ways. TLC’s High-Volume
For-Hire Vehicle Green Rides Initiative
will result in companies like Uber
and Lyft making all trips in EVs by
2030, with an exception for trips in
wheelchair-accessible vehicles. And
TLC will work closely with drivers,
for-hire vehicle companies, and other
partner agencies to help drivers
access EVs, adequate charging, and
incentive programs. The City will
help TLC licensees purchase EVs by
seeking a funding source to create
a targeted, limited-term vehicle
purchase program to help close the
purchase price gap between an EV
and a traditional car. Lastly, as the City
works with Federal, State, and private
sector partners to increase fast and
Level 2 charging for the public, we will
focus on improving charging access
for taxi and for-hire vehicle drivers
near their homes, high-volume trip
corridors, and popular destinations.
 Electrify school buses by 2035
More than 11,000 NYC school buses
transport 150,000 students to school
each day.262, 263 These buses run on
diesel fuel, generating GHG emissions
that contribute to climate change
and localized air pollution that can
cause health impacts. To reduce
these impacts, New York State set
ambitious electrification goals for our
school bus fleet to achieve including
new buses to be electric starting in
2027 and a fully electric school bus
fleet by 2035. The City will leverage
State and Federal funding for electric
buses, launch a training program for
electric school bus operators, and
incorporate electrification milestones
into the 2025 contract renegotiations
with school bus vendors.

CITY LEADING BY EXAMPLE
Farms at NYCHA
Farms at NYCHA is an urban
agriculture initiative grounded in
resident leadership and community
collaboration; the farms not only
expand healthy food access but
also provide youth workforce
and leadership development.
In 2013, the NYCHA Red Hook
Houses campus launched the
first farm, to build an outdoor
community gathering place,
produce something tangible and
usable, and activate open space.278
In addition to Red Hook Houses,
there are now farms at Wagner
Houses, Howard Houses, Bay
View Houses, Forest Houses,
Mariners Harbor Houses,
and Pink Houses.279 In 2021,
NYCHA’s seven farms produced
In recent years, measures have
been implemented to mitigate
the impacts of citywide droughts;
however, the vast majority of
community gardens in NYC
still access water from nearby
fire hydrants to irrigate plants
and vegetables.283 The Bipartisan
Infrastructure Law provided
funding for watershed programs.284
In 2022, the United States
Department of Agriculture

Food is the leading source of
household consumption-based
emissions in NYC, responsible for 27%
of total emissions.271 Reducing red
meat in favor of plant-based foods like
lentils, beans, fruits, vegetables, and
whole grains will improve the health
of New Yorkers, strengthen the health
of our planet, and transform a system
that incentivizes poor nutrition and
negatively impacts natural resources.
The way we grow and cook our
food also makes a difference in our
environment. Runoff from farms is a
key source of water pollution across
the United States, and within NYC,
charbroilers and grills in restaurants
are the largest single source of
fine particulate air pollution.272
We have been a leader in transforming
the food system for years. In 2008,
the City recognized that diseases
such as diabetes and cardiovascular
disease were on the rise and that poor
nutrition was a major contributor.273
The City took the first step in
promoting access to nutritious food
for all New Yorkers and linking food to
public health outcomes by establishing
standards for meals purchased and
served at public facilities. New York
City was among the first cities to
make school meals free to all public
school students. And through our
Good Food Purchasing Program, we
provide public details about the food
the City buys, including where food
comes from at all stages of the supply
22,000 pounds of organic fresh
vegetables, greens, and herbs.280
Green City Force (GCF), the
largest partner of Farms at NYCHA,
manages five farm sites as eco-hubs,
which are closed-loop systems
that support sustainability and
health.281 The farms are constructed
and operated by 18- to 24-yearold NYCHA residents who are
GCF AmeriCorps members.282
These young residents serve other
residents, create community ties,
and learn gardening and hard skills
in urban agriculture and green
infrastructure maintenance, which
gives them a deep understanding
of sustainable communities
rooted in social, economic,
and environmental justice.
awarded more than $46 million in
funding for water management to
NYC community gardens.285 The
investment will subsidize critical
on-site infrastructure improvements
to ease water access to more than
200 food-producing GreenThumb
community gardens under the
jurisdiction of NYC Parks across the
city. This investment in NYC’s social
infrastructure will allow thousands
of volunteer land stewards citywide
to grow more healthy and fresh food
while providing vibrant green spaces
for all New Yorkers.

food standards.274 In 2021, we became
the first U.S. city to join the Coolfood
Pledge to measure and reduce our
emissions associated with procured
food by 25% by 2030.275 In addition,
the Mayor’s Office of Food Policy
established the City’s first 10-year
food policy plan, Food Forward NYC,
to reach a more equitable, sustainable,
and healthy food system by 2031.276
In 2022, we took a bold new step by
limiting the amount of red meat that
could be served by City agencies and
introducing minimum servings for
plant-based proteins.277 Going forward,
we will incorporate food consumption
and production patterns into our overall
climate action agenda, with a special
focus on the food that is grown in
NYC’s watershed.
OUR PLAN
Our plan will aim to reduce emissions
from food grown by, purchased
by, and served to New Yorkers.
To address the emissions from
agriculture, we will ensure City
agencies comply with updated food
standards; promote lower-carbon
food purchases and healthier
meals; work with the private sector
to expand sustainable, carboncapture farming practices; and
provide resources for restaurants to
upgrade their commercial cooking
equipment. In doing so,
we recognize that the norms of the
food system have changed and
that consuming delicious, healthy
food is desirable for New Yorkers
and the environment.

Reduce
emissions from
commercial
cooking
26
Commercial cooking, specifically
charbroiling, accounts for almost
40% of local fine particulate (PM2.5)
emissions in New York City.292 These
emissions contribute to a multitude
of health issues, including asthma,
heart disease, and lung cancer.293
Additionally, 12% of the city’s black
carbon emissions—the black sooty
material emitted from burning fossil
fuels—come from restaurants.294
Reducing these emissions could
prevent more than 300 deaths
and 200 emergency room visits
every year.295 We are primed to
address this significant source of
air and GHG pollution through the
2016 Air Code regulations that
will require appropriate emissions
control in establishments with a
high volume of charbroiling.296
 Require retrofitting of
charbroilers by 2027
Phasing in appropriate mitigation
policies requires thoughtful
implementation by DEP in
collaboration with both the restaurant
and emissions control industries. By
December 2024, DEP commits to
enacting a rule to require retrofitting
of existing but uncontrolled underfired charbroilers. Enforcement of
the rule would start in December
2027 to give the restaurant industry
time to come into compliance with
the rule. Charbroilers will require an
emission control device that reduces
particulate matter emissions by
at least 75%.297 While a handful of
regulators at the State and local
level have passed similar regulations,
none have achieved widespread
compliance due to barriers that
include availability of technology,
cost, and complexity of installation.

The City has invested approximately
$400 million in helping watershed
farmers adopt sustainable land
use and water quality-safe farming
practices through a partnership
 Develop an NYC Restaurant
Accelerator Program to assist
businesses with compliance
We recognize that there are barriers
to compliance with new emissions
regulations for restaurants, including
the limited availability of applicable
technologies and significant
expenses for retrofitting equipment
that can range from $50,000 to
$225,000 with installation costs.
In response, the City is committed
to developing and seeking funding
for an innovative NYC Restaurant
Accelerator Program that will
provide businesses facing financial
hardship with a needs assessment,
technical support, and an approach
to securing grant funding to help
make our commercial cooking
infrastructure more sustainable.
DEP and other agencies will engage
with small businesses, industry, and
other stakeholders throughout the
development of the NYC Restaurant
Accelerator Program.

climate-friendly BMPs could be
replicated at urban farms within the
five boroughs or at City-owned sites.  Create an incentive program
to support farmers in the
NYC watershed who expand
agricultural production of fruits
and vegetables
It takes resources for farmers to
expand climate-beneficial agricultural
practices and food production. They
may need technical and financial
support to advance changes in their
operations. DEP funds agricultural,
forestry, and economic viability
programs, carried out by WAC, for
farmers in the West-of-Hudson
watershed. This allows the City to
protect water quality while supporting
agricultural sectors in upstate New
York. Through our partnership with
WAC, we will seek to assist farmers
in the watershed who expand their
production of fruits and vegetables.
We will also leverage DEP’s existing
funding for activities such as
marketing, training, event planning,
and staffing, which help farmers
connect with buyers and expand
their markets. The City will continue
to fund Pure Catskills, WAC’s
regional buy-local campaign that
promotes hundreds of farming,
forestry, and local businesses
throughout New York’s upstate
counties.300 Pure Catskills, which
had 325 members in 2022, will help
farmers make connections with
local and downstate customers
and wholesale buyers looking to
purchase regionally grown produce.301
“My husband and I don’t come from farming families, so we
didn’t have a hereditary claim to an existing farm. We were
able to buy Berry Brook because of a conservation easement.
It made the farm cheaper because the development rights
belong to the Watershed Agricultural Council and it gave
the prior owners, who were dairy farmers, money when they
sold the rights.
We grow organic vegetables and sell mostly at farmers markets
upstate. We are about to sell in two markets in New York City.
All the water on our property goes into the West Branch of the
Delaware, which goes straight into the Cannonsville Reservoir.
The system that gets unfiltered water to the biggest city in
the country is excellent, but we’ve taken resources from the
area. The reservoirs are in the lowest land, which is the best
farmland. That was taken 180 years ago from our communities
by eminent domain. The City has a responsibility to support
upstate agriculture and infrastructure. We have talked to our
kids about where the water from our streams ends up. We
were just in the City and we went to the American Museum
of Natural History. We were filling up our water bottles at the

GREEN ECONOMY
The green economy represents
industries and workers that are
contributing to our decarbonization
and environmental goals. Growing
the green economy will unlock
enormous investments while
creating a strong and resilient city
for future generations. It means
investing in public education and
training to prepare students for
green jobs, more well-paying and
accessible jobs, and a supportive
landscape for small and expanding
businesses. The green economy
will generate new businesses,
industries, institutions, products,
and technologies while also creating
pathways for traditional companies
to transition away from carbon- and
waste-intensive processes toward
low-carbon or net-zero solutions.
These transformations will be a
boon to New York City’s large and
diverse base of entrepreneurs
and workers who can help discover
and scale climate solutions.
Since the release of the first PlaNYC
in 2007, the City’s green economy
has grown substantially. In 2021 there
were at least 140,000 New Yorkers
employed in the green economy
with key employment clusters in the
building decarbonization, renewable
energy, climate adaptation, green
finance, and waste management
industries.302 We are planning
creatively across several interlocking
areas of focus—climate, public
education, economy, infrastructure,
and housing—to accelerate job

Neighbors: A Blueprint for Housing
and Homelessness.
305 These plans,
coupled with public and private sector
OUR PLAN
Our plan recognizes that the future
of our green economy, and our ability
to create and capture the enormous
investment in a just transition, will
require both transformation and
invention. The City will rigorously
chart the path to prepare New
Yorkers of all backgrounds to work
on the frontlines of sustainability
and resilience investments and
businesses. We will advance critical
new technologies, some of which
have demonstrated their value in other
markets but have yet to penetrate
the NYC market, and others that
are only on the cusp of research,
development, and commercialization.
We will work with Federal, State, and
local governments to harness policies
and generational investments across
green industries including energy
storage, embodied carbon, and
energy efficiency.
Our initiatives will help address
disparities in access and support
economically vulnerable New Yorkers
facing significant barriers to gainful
employment. Through NYC Public
Schools, private and nonprofit
partners, and the City University of
New York (CUNY) post-secondary
programs, we will focus on training
the next generation of workers
for the jobs of the future to meet
greenhouse gas emissions reduction
goals, fill talent gaps, and ensure
equitable pathways into jobs with high
economic mobility.
In addition, through new public-private
partnerships focused on sustainable
construction; building energy
efficiency; and renewable energy
generation, storage, and charging,
we will expand the number and
success of small and startup Minority,
Woman, Disadvantaged Business

Education plays a key role in building
climate literacy and encouraging
sustainable behaviors. Our plan
is to implement a strong set of
educational and training programs
that will empower our youth to be at
the center of the green economy. We
will accomplish this by training our
educators in the latest climate science
and technology. We will create new
opportunities where climate education

The Department of Education (DOE)
will lead the integration of climate
education and action across all
subjects and grade levels through
new educator training. A teacher
leadership team of up to 50 teacherleaders across different schools will
provide up to 1,000 educators with
professional development through
climate education trainings, workshops,
and programs. DOE will also establish
a school certification program for
climate education, supporting up to 25
schools per year in achieving climate
credentials. Additionally, DOE will
launch its inaugural Climate Action
Day in all public schools in the 2023-
2024 school year, showcasing the
importance of climate education and
sustainability practices.

Our plan will advance green workforce
development with an emphasis on
underserved and environmental
justice communities. We will
support skills-based and industry
specific training to enhance the
economic mobility of unemployed
and underemployed New Yorkers
and prepare them for strong career
pathways with family-sustaining wages.
 Position New Yorkers for fulfilling
green economy careers
This year, the City will release a
comprehensive green economy
industry action plan that will highlight
priority industries, identify in-demand
skills and occupations, and recommend
actionable opportunities, partnerships,
and interventions to help create an
equitable green workforce. The action
plan will identify viable pathways for
New Yorkers to take advantage of the
opportunities created by public, private,
and philanthropic investment in growing
climate innovation. Using these insights,
we will launch new talent development
programs, including occupational
training and apprenticeships that
promote economic mobility for New
Yorkers through green economy
jobs. The City will work with industry,
educational institutions, and nonprofit
training providers to develop pathways
that match local talent to promising
opportunities in the green economy
and address skill gaps and needs in
the workforce. Using data analysis
and stakeholder feedback, we will
ensure that investments are directed
to sectors and occupations that will
benefit New Yorkers the most.
Transformations taking shape in our
most carbon-intensive industries,
such as the implementation of Local
Law 97 and the growing adoption of
electric vehicles, will also spur the
demand for new skills and new jobs.
We will work with training providers,
unions, and industry representatives
to deliver trainings and certifications
that help fulfill this growing demand
and accelerate decarbonization.

ecosystem will create 8,000 to 13,000
new jobs across multiple industries
in New York City by 2035, including
jobs that help meet new power
generation, supply chain, and local
business needs. Many of these new
jobs will be focused in green economy
sectors, including through component
manufacturing and support of M/W/
DBEs in construction and professional
services as they pivot to meet demand
in the offshore wind industry.311
The City will also partner with CUNY
campuses to develop facilities and
programming to train students for
jobs in offshore wind, including
as skilled machinists, fabricators,
engineers, environmental scientists,
and wind technicians. As an example
of our workforce commitment to
local communities, we are partnering
with Equinor and the Sunset Park
community to deploy $5 million in
grants. These grants will support
sustainable growth, empower
underserved communities, and lead
to climate justice in the offshore
wind ecosystem in New York City.
 Establish a Green Economy
Advisory Council in 2023
The City will establish a Green
Economy Advisory Council made
up of key stakeholders from across
industry, academia, government,
non-governmental organizations,
and workforce organizations with
representation from all five boroughs.
The Council will advise policy makers
and other stakeholders on longterm industry growth and identify
potential bottlenecks hindering
decarbonization. The Council
will provide expertise and enable
partnerships that the City needs to
ensure industry is working in tandem
with government to decarbonize all
sectors of the economy, build efficient
supply chains, and adapt to climate
change. The Council will also build
consensus around key ecosystem
gaps and opportunities through
the formation of subcommittees
with focus areas such as climate
finance, innovation, and education.
 Activate NYC’s climate resource
hubs and natural areas for
workforce development
The City is partnering with diverse
educational institutions to train
and educate New Yorkers for
green economy jobs and to foster
entrepreneurship in the climate and
environmental science sectors through
climate research and workforce hubs.
These programs and partnerships
will be hosted at new and repurposed
buildings on campuses where talent
from across these sectors can
interact, share ideas, and generate
solutions for real-world climate
problems. These hubs will provide
opportunities to generate research,
new products and services, and
knowledge that can be commercialized
locally, nationally, and internationally.
Along with growing green jobs, our
efforts will support the critical work
needed to restore ecosystems and
preserve endangered species.
GREEN ECONOMY SECTORS
In 2021, there were at least 140,000 New
Yorkers employed in the green economy
with key employment clusters in the building
decarbonization, renewable energy, climate
adaptation, green finance, and waste
management industries. The City’s efforts to
grow the green economy, coupled with private
sector actions and changes in consumer
preferences, could expand the green economy
to employ over 230,000 New Yorkers by 2030.

One example of the City implementing
an innovative campus concept is the
Trust for Governors Island, which is
expected to select an academic anchor
institution this year for its Center
for Climate Solutions.312 The new
center is planning to house research
and educational space. Proposed
programming includes new educational
degrees, workforce development
offerings in green economy sectors,
opportunities for people to interact
with the harbor, and construction
that incorporates sustainability and
resilience best practices.
A consortium at Floyd Bennett Field
in Jamaica Bay is an example of
good work already being done. This
consortium is repurposing historic
buildings and delivering programs that
support ecological education; training
for green jobs in biology, ecology,
planning, and environmental sciences;
and areas for coastal resilience
experimentation and research.313
Partners include the National Park

and to attract new innovators that
are advancing climate technologies
and the transition to cleaner energy.
The City has a robust landscape of
incubators and accelerators to support
startups and emerging businesses. Our
plan builds on commitments articulated
in the December 2022 Making New

to support climate entrepreneurship
in areas such as biotechnology,
building technologies (also known as
proptech) and energy storage through
piloting opportunities with a focus on
supporting startups and M/W/DBE
entrepreneurs who face hurdles to
bringing products to market.
 Launch new partnerships and
projects in 2023 to support
the growth of sustainabilityfocused biotechnology and
materials innovation
Earlier this year, we announced an
initiative to make biotechnology the
basis of new climate and sustainability
innovations and bring solutions
to market that will address our
growing climate and sustainability
challenges. The initiative will focus
on three key subsectors: materials,
food and agriculture, including
alternative proteins and bioenergy.
As a part of this focus, NYCEDC, in
partnership with the Brooklyn Navy
Yard and Newlab, announced a
first of its kind 50,000-square-foot
innovation space for companies using
biotechnology to transform food,
materials, and the environment.315
This space will provide offices,
research laboratories, events, and
programming to support the growth of
sustainability-focused biotechnology
startups and companies, with an
emphasis on creating opportunities
for women and people of color and
increasing diversity in the industry.
The City also issued a separate
Request for Expressions of Interest
for a Materials Innovation Hub which
will catalyze materials science
research and development, establish
connections to industries like fashion
and construction, support earlystage materials science companies,
and create opportunities for New
Yorkers from a diverse range of
backgrounds.316 Responses to
the Request for Expressions of
Interest from academic and other
entities will provide NYCEDC with
another set of potential partnership
opportunities in sustainable biotech
and materials innovation.
 Launch and expand climate
technology innovation,
commercialization, and
scaling opportunities
across local industries 
We will launch a Climate Innovation
Accelerator Network to advance our
offering project-based learning
opportunities for fellows from
CUNY and OpportunityNYCHA.
 Launch portal to connect
public agencies with private
startups and investors by 2024
This year, the City will develop
a digital “front door” to address
piloting challenges facing climate
technology startups. The digital
portal will provide information on
policy priorities and implementation,
regulations, and innovation
challenges, including those
encountered while working with City
or State agencies that may offer
testing or piloting opportunities. The
website will help startups network
with leading industry sponsors, gain
expertise in business expansion, and
decrease time-to-market delivery of
their products. The goal will be to
increase the number of businesses
receiving proof-of-concept
affirmation from credible institutions,
such as public sector entities. The
program will also facilitate learning
opportunities across NYC-based,
publicly oriented piloting programs
run by the City, State, or their
program partners. This initiative will
support best practices in climate
industries to scale local innovation
and strengthen and heavily market
New York City’s innovation brand.
 Provide resources to attract
international investments in
climate technologies
Other cities and countries have
invested significantly in climate
technology and research over the
last decade, creating promising
innovations and companies poised
to enter the U.S. market. Similar to
the early days of the technology
ecosystem, we need to invest
in resources that make it easier
for companies to integrate into
the U.S. market, acclimate to the
business culture, and navigate
the complexities of scaling a
business. NYC is well positioned
to attract international climate
technology companies with its
large technology ecosystem, robust
climate legislation, and international
dimension. To support this work,
the City will launch a Global Climate
Tech Hub initiative to establish
dedicated coworking spaces and
essential resources that will attract
and support mid-sized climate
technology companies in entering
the NYC market. We will establish
resources alongside established
partners to make it easier for
climate technology companies to
conduct business here, including
climate technology priorities and
overall sector growth by scaling up
best-in-class venture and innovation
studio models that help startups
research, test, and scale climate
solutions to some of our toughest
climate challenges. The Network
will work with multiple innovators
to deliver end-to-end support that
startups need to thrive; create
a community of practice and
advance models of innovation; and
support New York City’s ambitious
efforts to become a world-leading,
social-equity-centered capital for
climate technology and the green
economy. This work, which builds
and expands climate tech piloting
programs and innovation studios,
will help emerging solutions leverage
research to refine climate innovation
challenge areas, participate in
coalitions of actors best positioned
to streamline implementation of
climate technology, and engage
in pilots to test innovations in
live environments across NYC to
support the incremental growth of
our green economy sectors. For
example, in the energy storage
arena, NYCEDC and Newlab
launched the Resilient Energy Studio
in 2021.317 The City will build off of
the success of this studio to launch
its latest set of energy storage
pilots in 2023. Companies that
participate in the Resilient Energy
Studio will work with NYCEDC to
identify assets on which to evaluate
their energy storage concepts and
develop ways to scale safely. Also
in 2023, the City will launch a set of
micromobility public charging pilots
in partnership between NYCEDC,
the Department of Transportation
(DOT), Newlab and tech startups,
building on the success of the
EV-focused DOT Innovation Studio
that was launched in 2022. We will
also evaluate piloting opportunities
on the 491 million square feet of
real estate collectively managed
between NYCEDC, the New York
City Housing Authority (NYCHA),
and the Department of Citywide
Administrative Services that will
make our City-owned assets
available for the testing of innovative
technologies that support energy
efficiency.318 Through a publicprivate partnership with JLL

Made in NYC
Made in NYC is a nonprofit
initiative that supports more
than 1,500 local manufacturers
and makers in New York City,
with the recognition that local
manufacturing is essential to
an environmentally sustainable
city. Most manufacturers truck
in all the products they need
to survive and truck out their
waste. Alternatively, they can
begin to “close the loop” by
encouraging the recycling and
re-use of products that have
finished their original planned life.
Local manufacturers can divert
hundreds of tons of glass, plastics,
fabric, metals, cardboard, wood,
and building materials away from
landfills and into supply chains
for new industries. Because urban
manufacturers are located near

and paper are collected and
manufactured into new products.
New York City is home to the only
urban paper recycling mill in the
country, which recycles nearly
400,000 tons of paper into new
cardboard boxes each year.331 The
City also offers programs to make it
easy to collect and reuse or recycle
unwanted textiles, electronics, and
other goods.
For food scraps and yard waste, we
have the largest curbside organics
collection program in the country and
we turn that waste into compost as
well as other uses. At the Newtown
Creek Wastewater Resource
Recovery Facility, New Yorkers’ food
scraps and wastewater biosolids are
turned into renewable energy through
a full-scale co-digestion program
that the City has been running since
2016.332 Co-digestion means adding
food waste to the anaerobic digestion
phase of wastewater treatment to
produce biogas, compost, and other
soil amendments.333 We are also
continuing to look for ways to reduce
our waste before it is created and
have led the way by banning foam
products and working with the State
to ban plastic shopping bags.334
Our mission is to divert more waste
to reuse while ensuring that we are
processing as much as possible
within the city to capture economic
activity. Merely replacing the export
of mixed waste to landfills with
the export of organic material to
out-of-town composters would not
be sufficient because it would not
benefit our economic development.
When we capture material headed
for a landfill and turn it into local
manufacturing or use it to generate
energy, we create resilience, reduce
truck traffic, and add jobs.
OUR PLAN
Transitioning to a circular economy
will require improved infrastructure,
effective service delivery, data
collection, and nimble policymaking,
as well as the participation of every
resident and business. There is a
strong foundation for building a
circular economy in NYC and we
have already seen success with
organics collection and recirculation.
Our plan builds on this success
and involves two key components.
First, we will stitch together existing
organics policies, collection

economy, a model that replaces a
one-directional material flow from
product to waste with material flow
based on reuse, extended product
life, and recirculating components.
Because the supply of materials and
the demand are all within New York
City, the circular economy also offers
the greatest opportunity to create
manufacturing jobs within the city.
Since 2016, the City Council has also
supported the Made in NYC initiative
to facilitate the growth of local
manufacturing (see Made in NYC).
330
We are already investing in systems
that give new life to spent materials;
recycled metal, glass, plastic,
landfills.328, 329 Further, we can use
materials from what we throw away
to create new products and generate
value. Our waste system is still largely
a one-way flow of new products and
materials into the city and waste
materials shipped outside of the city,
mainly by barge and rail. Alternatively,
by putting these materials to use right
here in New York City we can develop
a circular economy that leads to the
creation of new jobs and furthers the
City’s climate goals.
Over the last decade, we have
seen a global shift toward a circular
programs, and infrastructure to develop
a comprehensive citywide program
for organics. This will offer a blueprint
for addressing historically difficult-torecycle waste streams. Second, we will
kickstart circular systems for hard-torecycle waste streams by expanding
our asphalt, wood, and construction
and excavation soil reuse programs.

 Launch citywide curbside
organics collection by 2024
More than one-third of New York
City’s residential waste per ton comes
from organics—materials originating
from living sources that are suitable
for composting, such as food scraps
and yard waste. Sending organics
to landfills releases methane, a
GHG about 85 times more potent
than carbon dioxide over a 20-year
period.336, 337 In October 2022, the City
launched a new curbside composting
program for the entire borough of
Queens. In its first 12 weeks, the
program was wildly successful,
diverting nearly 13 million pounds of
yard and food waste from landfills.338
To reach our climate goals, clean
up our streets, and eliminate food
sources for rats, the City will expand
this program citywide by fall 2024,
achieving a long-sought goal of
universal curbside composting with
a program that is cost effective.
This summer, DSNY is also expanding
its network of Smart Compost
Bins—24/7 food-scrap drop-off bins
accessed with a smart phone app—
from 250 to 400. Additionally, DSNY
will take the first step toward a
mandatory program with a requirement
for buildings to separate leaf and yard
waste. In March 2023, DSNY published
a draft rule to make separation for
leaf and yard waste mandatory, to
go into effect as curbside organics
service begins in each borough over
the next year and a half. DSNY will
continue to evaluate the best ways to
maximize diversion of organic material
from landfills, including a mandatory
separation of food waste.
While City facilities and current
contracts have enough capacity to
receive and process these increasing
deliveries of food and yard waste,
they are concentrated in just a few
locations. To ensure reliability and
reduce truck traffic impacts on
neighborhoods with transfer stations,
DSNY will issue a new solicitation
for additional organics processing
capacity this summer. Vendors will be
competitively selected to pre-process
the collected organics, remove
contaminants, and ensure the organics
are converted into beneficial products
such as compost or renewable
energy. As part of the solicitation,
vendors will have the option to deliver
pre-processed organics to select
DEP Wastewater Resource Recovery
Facilities for co-digestion.
 Expand commercial organics
separation requirements to all
food businesses by 2026
New York City’s more than 50,000
restaurants, grocery stores, and
other food-related businesses
generate nearly one million tons of
organic waste per year.339 These food
businesses are crucial partners in a
local circular economy for organics.
Local Law 146 of 2013 requires
certain food-related businesses to
separate back-of-house organic waste
handled by staff from refuse, provide
clearly signed bins for organics, and
arrange for organics to be collected,
transported, and processed by
licensed haulers.340 The City has taken
a phased approach, starting with
the largest food businesses. Today,
more than 20,000 larger restaurants,
chain restaurants, grocery stores,
hotels, arenas, food manufacturers,
and other establishments are
required to separate their food
waste for composting or digestion.
In February 2023, Mayor Adams
and DSNY announced a roadmap
to implement the nation’s largest
composting program to include
weekly collection of compostable
material that will be automatic,
guaranteed, free, and year-round
for every resident of the five
boroughs.346 It will be the first-ever
plan and commitment to reach
100% coverage citywide and will
include weekly collection of leaf
and yard waste, food scraps, and
food-soiled paper products.347
DSNY is planning to issue a
solicitation for additional organics
processing capacity in and
around the city to receive sourceseparated organics collected from
residents and DOE schools. The
selected vendors will pre-process
the collected organics, remove
any contaminants, and ensure
the organics are converted into
beneficial products such as
compost or renewable energy.
DSNY will also benefit from
investments at the Staten Island
Compost Facility, where upgrades
are nearly complete, to enable
more food scraps to be composted
with leaf and yard waste. As part
of the solicitation, vendors will
have the option to deliver preprocessed organics to select DEP
Wastewater Resource Recovery
Facilities for co-digestion.

The success of organics collection
efforts hinges on our ability to process
organics and transform them into
valuable products that can be used
locally. One of the ways the City will
handle the increased volume of organic
material is through the expansion
of DEP’s co-digestion program.
CITY LEADING BY EXAMPLE
DSNY and DOE launched the
Zero Waste School program in
2016, focusing on full separation
of recyclables and compostable
material at 100 schools receiving
curbside compost.348 We will
bring organics collection to all
public schools in the city by the
end of the 2023-2024 school
year. Organics collection in
schools reduces waste, supports
the City’s efforts to fight rats,
and generates compost. The
program also engages younger
New Yorkers and provides
education on the benefits of
local material cycles, furthering
the City’s transition to circularity.

“I grew up in public housing and really didn’t know much
about composting or sustainable systems. I joined Green City
Force and got a job at the Red Hook Community Compost
site. We were processing 190 tons a year of organic waste by
hand. It was insane but fun and I became the manager—it was
the largest human-powered compost site in the United States.
When I was a kid, I was germophobic, but composting got
me over it. I started to learn more about the good fungus,
microbiomes, and the healthy layer of organisms on our skin.
In 2020 I created Compost Power and built a 3-bin system
compost site in Canarsie at the Bayview Houses Farm. Now I
operate nine sites in all boroughs. Eight are on NYCHA land.
All of my staffers are NYCHA residents or former NYCHA
residents. We have processed 220 tons of organic waste in two
years. It reduces waste and also rodents. We are picking up
trash, pruning gardens, and collapsing the rat tunnels.
For composting sites, we choose hot spots in the community
where there may be a lot of crime. Crime moves elsewhere.
The sites are an oasis. We have tomatoes on the vine, wood
chips, and lush trees. It shows people we have a farm in our
backyard, in our home.”

SPOTLIGHT
Digestion transforms food scraps
primarily into biogas—less than 25%
of the volume remains as biosolids.341
DEP has decades of experience
processing large volumes of organic
wastes into renewable bioproducts,
including energy. DEP operates
75 anaerobic digesters spread
across 14 Wastewater Resource
Recovery Facilities (WRRFs) in all
five boroughs.342 These facilities can
reduce waste and produce beneficial
outputs such as soil amendments and
power while generating green jobs for
New Yorkers.
DEP is working to achieve 100%
biogas beneficial use at its WRRFs
and will maximize public-private
partnerships to accomplish this. As
detailed in the Biosolids Beneficial Use
Plan, DEP plans to increase beneficial
usage of biosolids from WRRFs to
more than 50% by 2025 through
three new negotiated acquisition
contracts and expects to reach 100%
by 2030.343 These new facilities will
reduce waste and produce beneficial
outputs such as soil amendments
and power while generating
green jobs for New Yorkers.
In April 2023, DEP will release a
Request for Expressions of Interest
to identify pathways to achieve
this 100% beneficial use goal. This
year DEP will also bring a biogas
purification system online at Newtown
Creek, in collaboration with National
Grid. By 2025, DEP will also complete
the installation of cogeneration
equipment at North River WRRF.
In locations where we co-digest
food scraps, we will achieve this
even faster. Currently, 95% of the
output of food scraps digested at
Newtown Creek are transformed into
valuable uses including renewable
energy, soil amendments, and
landfill cover, which replaces the
use of soil.344 By 2026, none of
these biosolids will be landfilled.
The City also broke ground on a
new Sustainability Hub at Hunts
Point WRRF that will include new
digesters, allowing it to accept and
process organics directly from the
neighboring Hunts Point Market.345
The first phase of construction will
be complete by 2027 and enable the
WRRF to accept 250 tons per day of
organics. A second phase that is in
design now could allow processing
of up to 1,000 tons per day.
DIGESTER AND BIOSOLIDS PLAN
The City will handle an increased volume of organic material through
the expansion of Department of Environmental Protection’s co-digestion
program. Co-digestion is the process of adding food and yard waste to the
anaerobic digestion phase of the wastewater treatment process to produce
new products like biogas, compost, and other soil amendments.

A key component of building circular
systems is bolstering local markets
for recirculated materials. As
recycling rates have been stagnant
for the past decade and there is a
lack of consistent secondary uses
for some materials, innovation must
identify new pathways and buyers
for historically difficult-to-recycle
materials. The City will partner with
local recycling and construction
industries to support the recirculation
of challenging materials.
New York City will also advocate for
the Waste Reduction and Recycling
Infrastructure Act at the State level
to create an Extended Producer
Responsibility (EPR) policy to shift
the end-of-life responsibility of
packaging and paper materials
upstream to the producers.
Right now, manufacturers have
no responsibility for recovering
or recycling their packaging or
paper products, leaving New York
taxpayers and municipalities to
pay the bill to process these
materials. An EPR program would
incentivize those manufacturers to
innovate to reduce waste, increase
recyclability, and remove toxins from
their products, lowering recycling
costs for cities and reducing waste in
landfills. EPR programs are common
throughout the world and have been
proven to increase recycling rates
and reduce methane emissions by
limiting the amount of waste that
enters landfills and reducing demand
for new raw materials. An EPR bill
for packaging and paper would also
provide desperately-needed funding
for New York City’s recycling program,
bolstering collection and funding new
investments in consumer education,
recycling sorting, and processing
infrastructure, ensuring a sustainable
future for recycling for decades
to come.

 Expand the NYC Parks’ tree
wood reuse pilot by 2024
NYC Parks generates an estimated
12,400 metric tons of woody debris
annually which, until recently, had no
end use and was sent to landfills.354
Collecting and recirculating such
a large quantity of wood presents
opportunities for both cost and
carbon reductions. A 10-year wood
reuse program could capture up to
38,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide
equivalent.355 We will study the best
way to expand this wood reuse pilot
to facilitate each step along the way,
from tree removal to woody debris
processing to identifying end users
of wood material. Parks will also
identify a site for a wood salvage and
processing operation.
 Expand the Clean Soil Bank
program by 2030
We will increase soil recycling and
utilization of recycled soils by City
agencies and for private resiliencefocused projects by increasing the
City’s Clean Soil Bank stockpile
operations from two days to three
days per week. We will also establish
Clean Soil Bank sites in additional
locations throughout the city
according to agencies’ needs for soil.
NOT
The Clean Soil Bank, a system
of direct soil exchanges between
generating and receiving sites in
OER’s land cleanup program,
was launched in 2012.356 The
system delivers clean, native soil
recovered from deep excavations at
construction sites for resilience and
remediation projects and supplies
soil to community and school
gardens. To date, the Clean Soil
Bank has kept more than 540,000
cubic yards of soil in NYC, saved
2.45 million miles of truck trips and
spared the atmosphere 5,300 metric
tons of carbon dioxide.357
In 2020, the Clean Soil Bank
opened a clean soil stockpile, a
fixed facility on surplus City land
in Brooklyn, to capture more clean
soil and save the City money by
encouraging City agencies to use
the free stockpile soil on City
projects instead of buying it from
vendors.358 Ten City agencies
use stockpile soil for purposes
that include restoring parks and
ballfields, planting beach grass at
recently opened City parks, and
raising grades at an ocean-front
housing development. In the
past two and a half years, the
clean soil stockpile has supplied
81,000 cubic yards of soil to City
operations and capital projects
for a savings of more than $1.8
million.359 Recently, stockpile
savings exceeded the City’s cost
to run the facility, allowing the
stockpile to operate in the black for
the first time.360
This circular effort to recycle
clean soil within the city replaces
the one-way flows of trucking
excavated soil beyond the city for
disposal and inbound clean fill
purchases. This results in fewer
truck miles driven, less diesel fuel
consumed, and reduced GHG
from the construction industry.
In eight years, the Soil Bank has
made more than 600,000 tons
of clean soil available to projects
across New York City.361 Clean
Soil Bank material has been used
to raise the grade in flood zones,
restore wetlands, implement
flood protection measures, and
remediate contaminated land.362

For the last 16 years, across three mayoral administrations,
New York City has been a leader among cities in facing the
challenges presented by climate change and transitioning
to a decarbonized economy. Through this fifth iteration of
our city’s strategic climate plan, we have laid out an action
agenda for a cleaner, greener, and more just city for all.
PlaNYC: Getting Sustainability Done is grounded in a
comprehensive understanding of the impacts of climate
change to New York City communities, as well as a more
complete picture of our GHG emissions footprint, including
a new consumption-based inventory. Through this plan
we also acknowledge that climate change is critically
interrelated to public health risks, population growth and
migration, environmental injustices, and the state of the
economy. The actions outlined in this plan will be realized
across the five boroughs, tracked annually in reports of
progress for each goal and initiative. Importantly, this
work will also have global repercussions as one of the
world’s largest economies—New York City—tirelessly
acts to mitigate its own impact on our planet, and to foster
cross-industry innovation to strengthen our future.
This is an all-of-government effort that builds on the
knowledge and experience of City government agencies, that
aims to maximize unprecedented available State and Federal
funding, that commits New York City government to lead by
example, and that seeks to broaden climate impact through
collaborations with public sector, private, and non profit
partners. We will push this agenda forward through these
initiatives, and through upcoming related efforts including
PowerUp, the results of a year-long study, that will lay out
the obstacles, opportunities, and implementation steps to
transition New York City to an electrified and decarbonized
electric power system, and the Environmental Justice Report
that will describe the present state of environmental justice
in New York City and provide a basis for a plan to more
systemically address environmental injustices in our city.
The Adams administration’s intent is to ensure that
environmental justice, public health, and climate
considerations are at the center of our governing
and budgeting process. This is how we will get
sustainability done in NYC on behalf of our neighbors.

PROJECTIONS
New York City has experienced
continuous growth, maintaining
its position as the nation’s most
populous city since the nineteenth
century and reflecting its
commitment to diversity and quality
of life.363 In addition, NYC’s density
has supported a low per-capita
carbon footprint as many residents
walk, bike, or use public transit to
reach their destination, share utility
systems with neighbors of their
multifamily apartment buildings, and
enjoy outdoor activities in public
parks and open spaces as opposed
to individually owned water-intensive
yards. Nevertheless, rising population
levels heighten the importance of
climate action, not only because an
increase in residents corresponds
with an increase in resource
demands, but also because many of
our communities face increasingly
severe climate threats. This plan’s
initiatives build upon our collective
knowledge and experience to

support sustainable growth while also
improving the lives of all New Yorkers.
New York City’s population increased
from 3.4 million in 1900 to 8.8 million
in 2020, a 120-year period marked
by steady growth over most decades
and strong recoveries following
population dips in the 1950s and
1970s.364 New York City experienced
its most recent population decline at
the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic
in 2020—driven by the relocation
of New Yorkers to less dense
parts of the country, emergency
restrictions on international migration,
and a higher-than-average death
rate. Although New York City lost
approximately 468,000 residents
between April 2020 and July 2022
(-5.3%), our population show signs
of rebounding once again.365 The
rate of population decline is slowing,
and domestic and international
migration have nearly returned
to their pre-pandemic levels.366

NYC’s population has increased steadily since
the 1900s and is expected to continue its
long-term growth trajectory, despite having lost
residents in recent years due to the COVID-19
pandemic. Population data is based on the
U.S. Census Bureau’s Decennial Census for
1900 through 2020, the U.S. Census Bureau’s
Population Estimates Program for 2021 and 2022
(with both years representing the population on
July 1st, not annual averages), and the New York
Metropolitan Council for 2030 through 2050.

The city’s share of residents of color increased
from 65% to 68.1% between 2000 and 202,
largely due to growing Asian and Hispanic
populations. Population data is based on the U.S.
Census Bureau’s Decennial Census for 2000,
2010, and 2020.

The city’s share of residents over the age of 65
increased from 11.7% to 14.9% between 2000

New York City’s population is expected
to continue its long-term growth
trajectory over the next three decades,
adding an estimated 250,000
residents in the 2020s (+2.9%),
200,000 in the 2030s (+2.2%), and
150,000 in the 2040s (+1.7%).367 As

ECONOMIC
OUTLOOK
New York City’s economy has a
multi-century track record of growth
and adaptation, continually reinventing
itself to meet the challenges of each
new age. The last two decades
marked tremendous economic growth
for the city with jobs reaching a
record high of 4.7 million in 2020.370
The city’s increasingly diverse mix of
industries and businesses, as well
as its transit access and amenities,
attracts talent from around the world
and has made our city one of the
fastest growing urban economies
of its scale in the United States
with jobs increasing at 1.5 times the
national average since 2000.371 New
York City is also the center of the
largest regional U.S. economy and
relies on the metropolitan area for
an interdependent ecosystem of
talent and businesses to provide a
range of goods, services, and shared
infrastructure.
In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic
initiated an unprecedented shock
to New York City’s economy,
forcing many businesses to close
and dislocating much of the city’s
economic activity. It created fears
that urban centers were especially
vulnerable, and many thought the
conditions that enabled the city to
thrive over recent decades would
catalyze its decline.
Three years later, our economy
shows strong signs of recovery. As
of February 2023, NYC jobs have
reached 99.1% of their pre-pandemic
February 2020 total.372 Office-based
industries like Finance & Insurance,
Real Estate, Information, and
Professional, Scientific & Technical
Services, and institutional sectors,
like Educational Services and
Health Care & Social Assistance,
have more than recovered
employment losses, surpassing
their February 2020 job levels.373
Yet challenges remain with many
workers travelling to the office part
time and tourism still below its preCOVID pandemic historic peak, which
sends rippling effects through the
service economy.374 Industries like
Retail Trade, Accommodation & Food
Services, and Arts, Entertainment
& Recreation remain below their
pre-COVID pandemic job levels, and
industrial sectors like Manufacturing
and Construction have been slower
to recover.375 Economic recovery
has not only varied across sectors
but also demographic groups; for
example, Black New Yorkers face an
unemployment rate that is four times
as high as that of white New Yorkers.376
Despite our remaining challenges,
New York City is doing what we
always do in times of crisis: respond
and adapt. We are facing both our
economic and climate challenges head
on. The City and State’s Making New
York Work for Everyone Plan, released
in December 2022, established a
framework and identified a broad
range of interventions to help the city
both rebuild and evolve its economy.377

This plan is already being implemented.
Whether harnessing the power
of our public realm to support
new forms of outdoor dining and
activity, allowing the conversion of
underutilized office buildings into
much-needed housing, or reinvesting
in neighborhood main streets, we will
create an environment that enables
businesses of all sizes and types
to start, grow, and thrive here. Our
efforts to address climate change also
create economic growth opportunities.
Our continued prioritization of
sustainability and resilience will fuel
the green economy and contribute
to an increasing share of high-quality
jobs in renewable energy generation,
building decarbonization, climate
technology, and other related fields.
We expect New York City’s
economy to fully recover and
continue on its long-term growth
trend. But it is not just about
growing jobs, it is also about
creating an inclusive economy that
continues to attract talent, provide
workers with livable wages, and
provide all New Yorkers with better
access to opportunity. The COVID19 crisis was both a reckoning
and an opportunity, demanding
that we interrogate the structural
flaws of our earlier recoveries and
challenging us to reimagine what
truly inclusive growth and shared
prosperity can and should be.

169Appendices PLANYC 2023 INDICATORS & METRICS
Term Definition
Adaptation  The process of adjusting to new climate conditions in order to reduce risks to valued assets. 
Backwater Valve  A device used to reduce flooding from sewer backups.
Biogas  A renewable energy source made up of a mixture of gases including methane, carbon dioxide, and
hydrogen sulfide produced by anaerobic digestion. 
Bioswale  Natural or designed channels that concentrate and convey stormwater runoff, preventing flooding and
often removing pollution. 
Carbon Footprint   The amount of greenhouse gases emitted due to the consumption of fossil fuels by a person, group, or
organization. 
Carbon Neutrality  A net-zero state of carbon dioxide emissions wherein the amount of carbon emitted is not more than the
amount absorbed from the atmosphere. 
Chronic Tidal Flooding/
Sunny-Day Flooding  
Temporary flooding of low-lying areas near a coast, also known as king tide flooding or nuisance flooding. 
Circular Economy  An economic system that minimizes waste and maximizes resource efficiency and reuse.   
Clean Energy  Energy that comes from renewable, zero-emission fuel sources. 
Climate Budgeting  A systematic process that incorporates science-based climate considerations into the budget decisionmaking process by evaluating how actions and spending today contribute to meeting longer-term climate
targets. 
Climate Change  A change in the state of the climate attributed to human activity that alters the composition of the global
atmosphere in addition to natural climate variability. 
Climate Resilience The capacity of a community, business, or natural environment to prevent, withstand, respond to, and
recover from a disruption. 
Cloudburst   A small, targeted, intense rainstorm that is highly localized. 
Combined Sewer Overflow  Occurs when rainfall mixed with sewage must be discharged into the harbor to prevent large volumes of
stormwater from overwhelming wastewater treatment plants during extreme rainfall events. 
Congestion Pricing   An economic strategy that attempts to regulate demand by increasing prices without also increasing
supply. 
Decarbonize   To reduce or eliminate carbon dioxide emissions from a process. 
Digester  A tank that aids in the decomposition of natural or organic waste.   
Embodied Carbon  GHG emissions arising from the manufacturing, transportation, installation, maintenance, and disposal of
building materials. 
Environmental Justice  The fair treatment and meaningful involvement of all people in the development of environmental laws,
regulations, and policies, regardless of race, color, national origin, income, or other socioeconomic or
demographic factors. 
Green Infrastructure  A set of practices that use or mimic natural systems to manage climate hazards like stormwater runoff
by collecting stormwater from streets, sidewalks, and other hard surfaces before it can enter the sewer
system or cause local flooding. 
GHG Inventory  A list of sources of emissions, and the amount of emissions from each source, using a standardized
methodology. 
Heat Pump  A device that provides heating and cooling to a building using a vapor-compression cooling cycle and
uses electricity as an energy source.
Mitigation  Processes that can reduce the amount and speed of future climate change by reducing emissions of
heat-trapping gases or removing them from the atmosphere. 
Resilience Hubs  Existing community spaces protected from climate-induced hazards such as flooding, extreme heat, and
power outages. 
Rain Garden  An area of trees, shrubs, perennials, and engineered soil, allowing rain to be naturally absorbed into the
ground instead of flowing into the sewer system.
Sea Level Rise  An increase in the volume and elevation level of the world’s oceans as a result of climate change. 
Storm Surge  The abnormal rise in seawater during a storm caused primarily by storm winds pushing water onshore. 
Tree Canopy Cover  The amount of the ground that is covered by the upper foliage, or canopy, provided by trees. 
Urban Heat Island Effect  Areas with higher temperatures relative to outlying areas, due to a high concentration of structures such
as buildings, roads, and other infrastructure, and limited greenery.

PlaNYC: Getting Sustainability Done reflects the hard work, ideas, creativity, and
dedication of hundreds of individuals from nearly every City agency and office; and
scores of community and non-profit organizations, elected officials, academics, and
business leaders who contributed their time, energy, and knowledge of the city to help
shape the vision and policies of this plan. The success of this effort would not have been
possible without their involvement and care.
