SEOUL--China has notified South Korea that it would be postponing a trilateral meeting of culture ministers with Japan scheduled for this month, South Korea's culture ministry said on Thursday.

China did not give a reason for the postponement. Beijing and Tokyo have been locked in an escalating diplomat dispute following a comment by Japan's prime minister about how Tokyo might react to a hypothetical Chinese attack on Taiwan.
