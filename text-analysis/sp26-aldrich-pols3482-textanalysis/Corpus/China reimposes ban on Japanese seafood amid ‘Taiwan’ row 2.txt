China has notified Japan that it will suspend imports of Japanese seafood, citing heightened monitoring over treated water from the crippled Fukushima No. 1 nuclear power plant.

Sources related to the Japanese government confirmed the suspension on Nov. 19.

The Chinese government is demanding stronger monitoring related to the treated contaminated water released from the Tokyo Electric Power Co.’s nuclear power plant in Fukushima Prefecture into the sea. 

The move also appears linked to the growing Chinese backlash over Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi’s remarks in the Diet on a potential Taiwan contingency, which would necessitate Japanese involvement. 

At a news conference on Nov. 19, Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Mao Ning said, “The Japanese side has still not provided the promised materials.”

She mentioned Takaichi’s remarks and said, “The incorrect statement has angered the Chinese people,” and “Under the current circumstances, even if Japanese marine products are exported to China, there is no market (to accept them).”

After once again demanding the withdrawal of Takaichi’s remarks, Mao said, “If the withdrawal is refused, we will have no choice but to take strict and resolute countermeasures, and all responsibility will rest with the Japanese side,” suggesting additional measures.

In August 2023, following the release of treated water from the plant into the sea, China imposed a blanket ban on all Japanese seafood imports.

However, in June this year, it decided to resume imports except from 10 prefectures.

After completing the necessary procedures, shipments of frozen scallops from Japan to China restarted on Nov. 7—just days before this latest suspension.
