## Summary of Module
This module goes over computational text analysis for a corpus of texts. The module includes a brief discussion on what is computation text analysis, how it is useful, the browser tools that can be used to do this method of analysis, and how to interpret the results. 

## Learning Goals
- Understand best practices for collecting and storing textual data when performing basic computational text analysis
- Understand how web-based computational text analysis programs work, such as in their behind-the-scenes data preparation
- Understand how to interpret the results from your text analysis

## Learning Objectives
- Define computational text analysis
- Follow along in a demonstration of web-based text analysis tools by DITI Fellows
- Word Counter, Word Trees, Lexos, Voyant
- Experiment with text analysis tools on your own
