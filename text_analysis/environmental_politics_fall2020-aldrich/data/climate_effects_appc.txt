This study estimates SLR projections
using three SLR scenarios (low to high)
to obtain values for the dynamic
discharge in varying the outlet glacier
velocities and discharge for Greenland,
Antarctic-Peninsula, glaciers and ice
caps. The eustatic contributions to SLR
from surface mass balance losses and
discharge of ice into the ocean through
marine-terminating glaciers is calculated
based on a scaled ratio and the thermal
expansion is based on the SRES
emission scenarios.

Range of 2-3 degrees C in annual

the coasts in the conterminous
United States by the end of the
21st century
By late this century (2070–2099),
average winter temperatures are
projected to rise 8 degrees F
above historic levels, and summer
temperatures to rise 11degrees F,
if heat-trapping emissions remain
high; under a lower-emissions
future, the warming is projected
to be about half as much
Currently, northeastern cities
experience one or two days per

number could increase by late
century to between three and nine
days under lower emissions and

Appendix C: Climate Change Effects Typology Matrix

2 Terminology
2.1 Certainty
The typology matrix includes a column for “certainty”. This column provides information regarding the level of certainty associated with the
projections cited in each study. 1) For USGCRP (2009) data, the “likely” and “very likely” terms represent one and two standard deviations from
the mean, respectively. This follows the definition provided by the IPCC (2007) where the term “likely” represents a greater than a 66%
probability and “very likely” represents a greater than 95% probability. 2) Other studies referenced may also use “likely” and “very likely” to
describe the certainty, but the authors of the typology matrix generally did not attempt to verify that each study uses the IPCC definition for these
terms. 3) For those studies that do not quantify certainty a qualitative description of study parameters that influence the level of certainty that can
be assumed is provided. Such parameters include information on the number of climate models, the climate sensitivity of those climate models if
known, and the choice of emission scenarios.

2.2 Emissions
The IPCC developed a number of emission scenarios described in the IPCC Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) (2000) associated with
plausible storylines representing varying degrees of projected economic, regional, and environmental change as well as allowing for global
integration. These studies tend to draw from the following IPCC SRES:
• A1Fi assumes very rapid per capita economic growth, global population peaking in 2050, rapid introduction of new and more efficient
technology but still fossil-intensive;
• A1B assumes very rapid per capita economic growth, global population peak in 2050, rapid introduction of new and more efficient
technology being evenly distributed between fossil and non-fossil technology;
• B1 assumes rapid changes in economy though slower growth than the A1 scenarios, same global population pattern as in A1, with new
technology becoming clean and resource-efficient;
• B2 assumes intermediate levels of economic development, continously increasing population (slower rate than A2), less rapid
technological change compared to A1 and B1;

C-142

Appendix C: Climate Change Effects Typology Matrix

• A2 assumes slowest economic development of all the scenarios in terms of per-capita growth, has the highest global population allowing
for a continuous increase in population, with the slowest and most fragmented technological development.
• There are also studies that provide projections based on the IPCC "Business as Usual" Scenario (termed IS92a Scenario). This scenario
increases the effective carbon dioxide concentration by 1% per year after 1990. The effective carbon dioxide concentration of this
scenario is somewhat higher than the effective carbon dioxide concentration of the A2 emission scenario (CCCma 2007).
