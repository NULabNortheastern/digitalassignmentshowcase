    "\n",
    "Using the *New York Times* API, we will explore the coverage of the Opioid Epidemic from 2010 to the present, showing you how to use the API to start a query, then show you how we go from unstructrued to structured data, providing examples of what we can do and say with this data. Some of these examples include graphing the number of opioid related article counts by year and tracking and ploting the frequency of key words used to frame and tag each of these articles. \n",

    "We will finish by showing you how to take the text from each article and save it as a .txt file to use in further text analysis with Lexos."
