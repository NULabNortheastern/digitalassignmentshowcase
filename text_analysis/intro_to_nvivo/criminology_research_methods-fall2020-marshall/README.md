## Summary of Module
This module will go over the basics of how to install NVivo and use the software as a literature review and research tool. Students will be introduced to the basic concepts of NVivo and then taught how to import documents, create nodes, and basic analytical visualizations and queries.
This module will ask students to choose one person to interview, transcribe that interview, and qualitatively code it using Nvivo. For this portion, we will use a sample source as well as the studentsâ€™ transcripts of their interviews to practice qualitative coding and visualizing results with NVivo.

## Learning Goals
Qualitative Coding with NVivo
* Define qualitative coding and why it can be useful while doing research
* Understand what NVivo is as a research tool and what it can do
* Learn important NVivo-specific vocabulary to aid independent research  

## Learning Objectives
* Create a basic set of nodes using sample transcripts
* Learn out to import data, create nodes, code data, and see/interpret results of coding
* Use NVivo to begin creating nodes and coding their own interview transcripts
