## Summary of Module
This module will demonstrate how to create a corpus of texts to be used for computational text analysis. The first part will go over the basics of research methods, the process of building a corpus, and discussion questions based on an example corpus. For the second part, students will be introduced to web-browser computational text analysis tools and begin practicing these tools by using sample data. Students will use digital technologies like Voyant, SameDiff, sentiment analysis tools, and more. 

## Learning Objectives
- Define important vocabulary such as corpus, research methods, computational text analysis, nGrams, sentiment analysis, and more.
- Describe ethical implications of creating a corpus, especially in writing studies
- Follow a step-by-step process for building a corpus that can be used for this project and future projects
- Use computational text analysis web-browser tools, such as Voyant and Storybench
- Create visualizations and explain results from computational text analysis tools
