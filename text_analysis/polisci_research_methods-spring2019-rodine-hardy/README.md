## Summary of Module
This module goes over computational text analysis for a corpus of texts. The module includes a brief discussion on big data, how computational text analysis is useful, the browser tools that can be used to do this method of analysis, and how to interpret the results. 

## Learning Goals
- Learn best practices for building a small textual corpus as well as some basic vocabulary
- Understand computational text analysis methods
- Understand how to use a variety of tools for text analysis and interpret the results

## Learning Objectives
- Know basic vocabulary around doing text analysis, such as corpus and stop words
- Learn steps for best practices when doing web-based computational text analysis 
- Use web-based computational text analysis programs, such as Voyant
