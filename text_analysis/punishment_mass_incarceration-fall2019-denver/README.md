## Summary of Module
The first part of this module will introduce ethics, including what big data is and how it works, algorithmic bias, and questions and guidelines for ethical research. Big data is the collection of mass amounts of data and the quick analysis of this data to categorize and re-categorize patterns of behavior. Algorithmic bias explores how these algorithms can reinforce implicit and potentially harmful biases, including biases in the data used and collected for algorithms, the choices made in algorithm creation, and the impact. Particularly, this module looks at algorithms in the criminal justice system, including algorithms used to predict recidivism risk. 

The second part of the module will introduce computational text analysis, particular web-browser text analysis tools like Lexos and Voyant. Steps for corpus preparation in Lexos will be shared, along with the different ways Lexos and Voyant analyze corpora. 


## Learning Goals
- Understand the ways in which technologies reflect cultural, social, and political biases 
- Understand the ways data is being used in society as well as how algorithms impact and shape our daily lives and the criminal justice system
- Learn best practices for building a small textual corpus as well as preparing it
- Understand computational text analysis methods, how to use a variety of tools for text analysis, and how to interpret the results

## Learning Objectives
- Define “big data” and point to different digital technologies that rely on this type of collection and analysis
- Point to algorithms that are used to make important decisions, like risk assessment algorithms and targeted advertising
- Tackle questions about implicit bias to be used when conducting research, especially collecting and analyzing data. 
- Use Lexos’ Preparation tools to transform the corpus, such as removing stopwords and lowercasing all the words
- Practice analyzing a corpus using Lexos and Voyant
