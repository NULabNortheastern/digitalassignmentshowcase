    "Using the *New York Times* API, we will explore the coverage of Global Warming from 2010 to the present, showing you how to use the API to start a query, then show you how we go from unstructrued to structured data, providing examples of what we can do and say with this data. Some of these examples include graphing the number of opioid related article counts by year and tracking and ploting the frequency of key words used to frame and tag each of these articles. \n",

So when the leading science academies in 20 developed countries, along with several major American corporations and the national security community, all tell us that burning fossil fuels is causing dangerous changes to the climate, we think it’s time for the United States to get serious about clean energy. It also means supporting safely operating nuclear power plants that produce carbon-free electricity.America must expand its clean-energy plans to make room for new, safer reactors.',\n",
