Using two Webcams, scientists discover a high correlation between canopy hue and carbon dioxide uptake in an English forest. As the seasons shift with global warming, they will be able to chart changes in uptake.The changing palette of colors in a forest signals more than the arrival of a new season. For those who know how to look, the colors also reveal how much carbon dioxide the trees are absorbing from the atmosphere during photosynthesis, a new study suggests. By analyzing thousands of photographs of a forest canopy less than 40 miles outside London, the researchers were able to estimate carbon uptake over a two-year period based on the leavesâ€™ hues.Using two Webcams, scientists discover a high correlation between canopy hue and carbon dioxide uptake in an English forest.
