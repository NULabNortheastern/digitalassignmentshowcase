    "Using the *New York Times* API, we will explore the coverage of Donald Trump from 2010 to the present, showing you how to use the API to start a query, then show you how we go from unstructrued to structured data, providing examples of what we can do and say with this data. Some of these examples include graphing the number of Donald Trump related article counts by year and tracking and ploting the frequency of key words used to frame and tag each of these articles. \n",

Trump, is there really anything that funny about him, other than his relentless self-promotional streak, the seesawing fortunes of his “Apprentice” reality-television franchise, his string of marriages and his enigmatic hairline? That’s for the comedians to figure out: Mr. Trump, the real-estate mogul and media personality, will be the next victim guest of honor at a Comedy Central roast, the cable channel said on Thursday. “The Comedy Central Roast of Donald Trump” will be taped on March 9 – the first such roast to be filmed in New York since 2005, back when Comedy Central felt the comedian Jeff Foxworthy deserved the distinction – and broadcast in the spring. No slander-slinging panelists were immediately announced for the event, but if tradition holds, Mr. Trump can look forward to a speedy elimination from a future season of “Dancing With the Stars.”',\n",

That’s for the comedians to figure out: Mr. Trump, the real-estate mogul and media personality, will be the next victim guest of honor at a Comedy Central roast, the cable channel said on Thursday. “The Comedy Central Roast of Donald Trump” will be taped on March 9 – the first such roast to be filmed in New York since 2005, back when Comedy Central felt the comedian Jeff Foxworthy deserved the distinction – and broadcast in the spring. No slander-slinging panelists were immediately announced for the event, but if tradition holds, Mr. Trump can look forward to a speedy elimination from a future season of “Dancing With the Stars.”', 'source': 'The New York Times', 'multimedia': [], 'headline': {'main': 'You’re Roasted: Comedy Central Plans Satiric Salute to Donald Trump', 'kicker': 'ArtsBeat', 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': None, 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}, 'keywords': [], 'pub_date': '2010-12-16T19:57:30+0000', 'document_type': 'article', 'news_desk': '', 'section_name': 'Arts', 'byline': {'original': 'By Dave Itzkoff', 'person': [{'firstname': 'Dave', 'middlename': None, 'lastname': 'Itzkoff', 'qualifier': None, 'title': None, 'role': 'reported', 'organization': '', 'rank': 1}], 'organization': None}, '_id': 'nyt://article/71293ac6-f61c-580e-9c0c-d352eee0bff7', 'word_count': 150, 'uri': 'nyt://article/71293ac6-f61c-580e-9c0c-d352eee0bff7'}, {'abstract': 'Mrs. Sabatini, who owned Sabatini’s restaurant, next to one of Donald Trump’s casinos, fended off condemnation proceedings that would have given the casino her property by eminent domain.', 'web_url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/01/nyregion/01sabatini.html', 'snippet': 'Mrs. Sabatini, who owned Sabatini’s restaurant, next to one of Donald Trump’s casinos, fended off condemnation proceedings that would have given the casino her property by eminent domain.', 'lead_paragraph': 'Pacific Avenue isn’t usually a sought-after property in the game of Monopoly, which uses real Atlantic City street names.

Trump, is there really anything that funny about him, other than his relentless self-promotional streak, the seesawing fortunes of his “Apprentice” reality-television franchise, his string of marriages and his enigmatic hairline? That’s for the comedians to figure out: Mr. Trump, the real-estate mogul and media personality, will be the next victim guest of honor at a Comedy Central roast, the cable channel said on Thursday. “The Comedy Central Roast of Donald Trump” will be taped on March 9 – the first such roast to be filmed in New York since 2005, back when Comedy Central felt the comedian Jeff Foxworthy deserved the distinction – and broadcast in the spring. No slander-slinging panelists were immediately announced for the event, but if tradition holds, Mr. Trump can look forward to a speedy elimination from a future season of “Dancing With the Stars.”',\n",
