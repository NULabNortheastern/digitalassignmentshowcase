## Summary of Module
This module will demonstrate how to create a corpus of texts to be used for computational text analysis. It is a two-day workshop module. The first day will go over the basics of research methods, the process of building a corpus, and discussion questions based on an example corpus. For the second day, the students will bring in the beginnings of their corpora and use the example corpus and their own corpus to begin practicing computational text analysis using digital technologies like Voyant, SameDiff, sentiment analysis tools, and more. 


## Learning Objectives
- Important definitions, such as corpus, research method, computational text analysis, and more
- The ethical implications for creating a corpus
- A step-by-step process for building a corpus that can be used for this project and future projects
- Computational text analysis tools
