Murmurs…
In school I could hear the murmur of voices
reading, laughing. They seeped into the hallway
under the gap beneath the door.
There were portraits of important people,
important white men
up on the wall in the entryway
under a slightly tattered American flag.
They looked like the ghosts of order.
We knew they’d be there watching,
making sure we didn’t
step too far out of line.
Now, the entryways have metal detectors,
giant rectangular gates.
Instead of a “hello,”
Students are greeted with an
“I don’t trust you.”
In school I could smell
ink and paint,
those hopeful chemicals
that spill words and dreams
into the world.
Now you smell
fear.
