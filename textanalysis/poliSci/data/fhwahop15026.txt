Dear Colleague:
The increased frequency and severity of disasters continue to tax the personnel, resources and capabilities of
State and local departments of transportation. Whether it’s Transportation Systems Management and
Operations (TSMO), maintenance, emergency managers, infrastructure or planning offices – all must respond
and adapt to what has become the new reality – one that incorporates the impacts of climate change into the
decision making process.
Though transportation agencies have made significant advances in mainstreaming TSMO and maintenance
into their core business processes in the past decade, climate change poses a risk to continuing TSMO and
maintenance improvements and threatens to erode the public trust in a safe, reliable infrastructure. This is
captured in the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) Order issued in December 2014, in compliance
with 2013 Executive Order 13653, Preparing the United States for the Impacts of Climate Change.
The challenge in developing this primer, Climate Change Adaptation Guide, reflects the challenge inherent in
understanding climate change and its impacts on transportation as we know it, i.e., finding ways to help very
different and diverse sets of stakeholders understand the benefits of reaching across institutional divides in
order to work together to achieve common objectives.
The audience for the primer includes TSMO and maintenance program managers, emergency managers,
planners and supervisors involved in all operational aspects that are likely to be affected by climate change.
The content features the following:
• Context and Rationale for Adapting to Climate Change,
• What’s Already Being Done,
• Steps to Adapt TSMO and Maintenance Programs to Climate Change, and
• How to Get Started.
We look forward to receiving your feedback, reactions, and experiences in implementing these concepts.
Please direct any comments, questions, and suggestions to Laurel Radow at Laurel.Radow@dot.gov or

This guide provides information and resources to help transportation management, operations, and
maintenance staff incorporate climate change into their planning and ongoing activities. It is intended
for practitioners involved in the day-to-day management, operations, and maintenance of surface
transportation systems at State and local agencies. The guide assists State departments of transportation
(DOTs) and other transportation agencies in understanding the risks that climate change poses and actions
that can help reduce those risks. Incorporating climate change considerations into how agencies plan
and execute their transportation system management and operations (TSMO) and maintenance programs
helps the agency become more resilient to unanticipated shocks to the system. Adjustments to TSMO and
maintenance programs—ranging from minor to major changes—can help to minimize the current and
future risks to effective TSMO and maintenance.

I. Introduction to this Guide
Ensuring safety, reliability, and mobility guides the functioning of department of transportation (DOT)
transportation systems management and operations (TSMO) and maintenance programs around the
country. With the infrastructure mostly built out, and in many cases reaching the end of its lifespan, the
emphasis on TSMO and maintenance has continued to grow at both State and local levels.
Transportation agencies have made significant advances in mainstreaming TSMO and maintenance into
their core business processes over the last decade. Investments in technology and systems for traffic
monitoring and management, traffic incident management, and to provide traveler information have
supported the capability of agencies to monitor, respond to, and communicate conditions to travelers.
Similar improvements in maintenance management have occurred with use of material management
systems, improved maintenance and construction strategies, and more robust asset management techniques.
Climate change poses a risk to continuing improvements in this area and threatens to erode the public trust
in a safe, reliable infrastructure.1 DOTs are already observing and responding to the impacts of climate
change. Infrequent but extreme weather events (e.g., floods, hurricanes, Southern snowfalls) are becoming
more frequent, and long-term climatological trends are slowly but inexorably changing how transportation
systems will need to be planned, designed, operated, and maintained.2
Transportation Systems Management and Operations (TMSO), Maintenance, and Climate
Change
State department of transportation (DOT) TSMO and Maintenance Programs are vulnerable to climate
change. Climate change increases uncertainty around planning for extreme weather events, since the past
is no longer a reliable predictor of the future. Climate changes could result in:

 Loss of roadway capacity.
 Loss of alternative routes.
 Loss of situational awareness (due to power/communications outages).
 Inability to evacuate.
 Loss of service life (due to faster deterioration).
 Increased safety risk.
 Loss of economic productivity.
 Reduced mobility.

Climate change risks are as yet not well-understood by TSMO and maintenance groups. Most of the
discussion around climate risks has been at a long-term planning level or from an infrastructure design
standpoint. Consequently, adapting to climate change is still new to the operating divisions within the
DOT. Many agencies are, nevertheless, finding that the approaches and practices that made them
successful operators and maintainers of facilities are not adequate—or at least need to be revisited—with
this change in climate. More frequent events, unusual phenomenon, and changes in long-standing patterns
combined with steadily increasing funding and workforce pressures put agencies at a crucial juncture on
how to plan for effective operations and maintenance.
Incorporating climate change considerations into how agencies plan and execute their TSMO and
maintenance programs helps the agency become more resilient to unanticipated shocks to the system.
Adjustments to TSMO and maintenance programs—ranging from minor to major changes—can help to
minimize current and future risks to effective maintenance and operations.
This guide provides information and resources to help DOT TSMO and maintenance staff incorporate
climate change into their planning and ongoing activities. It will assist State DOTs and other transportation
agencies to understand the risks that climate change poses and actions that can help reduce those risks.
Although there is continually new information emerging about anticipated risks and strategies to address
them, there is sufficient information to begin a more concerted effort to evaluate programs and begin to
make or plan to make adjustments today.

• Over the last 20 years, we have gotten really
good at managing winter storms. We will
deal with whatever nature throws at us.
Do I need to plan for climate change?
• My last few summers have resulted in a lot
of delays in construction due to the heat.
Should I change how I bid out my projects?
• Over the last 20 years, we’ve never had an ice
storm, and I don’t typically budget for ice
removal equipment. We got one last year.
Should I invest?
• My maintenance budgets are typically
insufficient, and I end up going over each
year. How can I plan ahead and better use
my limited resources?
• We worked well together during Hurricane
Sandy, but there were still a lot of challenges.
What will help us be better prepared?

Figure 2. Graph. Overlapping Responsibilities of Different Transportation Agency Offices.

A. Who Should Use this Guide?
This guide is meant for practitioners involved in the day-to-day management, operation, and maintenance
of surface transportation systems at State and local agencies. Climate change will affect different offices
and their varying responsibilities in different ways. As shown in Figure 2, some responsibilities among
this staff are also overlapping and will require coordination. For example, DOT emergency management
staff and TSMO staff need to coordinate during an emergency to provide accurate and up-to-date traveler
information. In some DOTs, staff may serve both a TSMO and maintenance function. All staff might have
a role in major emergencies. In a majority of functional areas, TSMO and maintenance depends on the
collaboration between multiple agencies.
Unless otherwise specified, the content in the guide is applicable to all:
 State and local DOT TSMO and maintenance managers.
 State and local DOT planning staff.
 Metropolitan planning organization (MPO) staff.
 State and local DOT emergency management staff.

B. How Will this Guide Help Agencies Adapt?
The guide provides the rationale and specific guidance for integrating the capability for climate change
adaptation and extreme weather response into TSMO and maintenance programs. It also articulates why
doing so will lead to greater sustainability.

3

In laying out both the need for integration of adaptation into decision making and approaches to do so, this
guide also takes a first step toward beginning to establish a consistency of language and practice that will
facilitate much-needed collaboration and coordinated action across operating groups within and outside
the agency.
The guide provides resources to help agencies:
 Self-evaluate where practices need to be altered to enhance resiliency to climate change.
 Identify what changes need to be made.
 Assess the benefits and co-benefits of making those changes.
 Map out the changes in capabilities that need to be taken to implement them.

C. What this Guide Does Not Cover
The guide is a first effort to provide guidance on how to adapt TSMO and maintenance programs to
climate change. This is a quickly evolving field as evidenced by the rapidly emerging research by top-level
national and international agencies (e.g., United Nations, National Academies). There are still many
knowledge gaps in terms of adapting practices, including risk management and probabilistic decision
making. This document reflects what is known today, but does not answer all the questions that
practitioners are certain to raise.
The guide also does not provide guidance on related topics that are better described in other documents (e.g.,
how to respond during extreme or adverse weather). As mentioned above, this guide is focused on helping
agencies do the “up-front” work to prepare for addressing climate change and extreme weather events.

D. How to Use this Guide
The guide provides context, an overview of steps, and specific resources to help DOTs get started to adapt
TSMO, maintenance and emergency management programs to climate change. Users may come to the
guide with varying levels of familiarity with the content and issues presented herein. It is, thus, designed
so that the Table of Contents can be used to jump to any section in the guide where users find content
relevant to their specific needs. Of particular note:
 Section IV describes the general planning components needed to adapt a TSMO and maintenance
program for climate change.
 Blue text boxes throughout the guide (titled “Getting Started”) contain specific resources to help
agencies get started with adaptation, such as checklists and other resources.
 Green text boxes throughout the guide (titled “Examples from the Field”) provide lessons learned and
best practices from around the country. These examples help to illustrate the more general guidance
provided and highlight the diversity of issues and approaches to addressing them.

II. Context and Rationale for Adapting to
Climate Change
A. Federal Highway Administration Action on Climate Change
Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) recognizes that climate change and extreme weather events
pose a significant challenge to the safety, reliability, effectiveness, and sustainability of the national
transportation system. In 2014, FHWA issued a directive that establishes FHWA policy on preparedness
and resilience to climate change and extreme weather events, in compliance with Executive Order 13653,
Preparing the United States for the Impacts of Climate Change, issued in 2013. The FHWA directive
provides several ways in which “FHWA will integrate consideration of the risks of climate change and
extreme weather event impacts and adaptation responses, into the delivery and stewardship of the Federalaid and Federal Lands Highway programs,” including encouraging State departments of transportation
(DOTs), metropolitan planning organizations (MPOs) tribal governments, and others to develop costeffective strategies to minimize climate and extreme weather risks.3
FHWA began activities to address climate change in the early 2000s with several white papers followed by
in-depth studies on the impacts of both climate variability and climate change in the Gulf Coast as well as
sea level rise on the Atlantic Coast. FHWA’s next steps to address climate change were to develop tools
and information that could be used by State DOTs and MPOs to assess their vulnerabilities to climate
change. FHWA also continues to analyze strategies that can help improve resiliency. For additional
information on FHWA’s climate change efforts, see the FHWA web page, "Summary of FHWA Climate
Adaptation Initiatives." 4
The FHWA Order and ongoing research activities are intended to promote transportation system resiliency,
defined as the ability to anticipate, prepare for, and adapt to changing conditions and withstand, respond to,
and recover rapidly from disruptions. Much of the work to date has been focused on assessing
vulnerabilities and considering transportation infrastructure and design adaptation. This guide specifically
focuses on how agencies can reframe TSMO and maintenance programs to increase resilience to the
uncertainty and variability associated with climate change.

B. What is Transportation Systems Management and Operations and
Maintenance?
This guide focuses on two primary transportation functions: 1) transportation systems management and
operations (TSMO) and 2) maintenance. These functions both involve the day-to-day activities that maximize
the use of transportation infrastructure. TSMO refers to an integrated approach of programs, projects, or
services designed to get the safest and most efficient use out of existing and planned infrastructure. TSMO
functions include traffic management, traffic incident management, traveler information services, traffic signal
coordination, transit priority/integration, freight management, work zone management, planned special event
management, road weather management, and active transportation and demand management.
Maintenance activities help to preserve and extend the use of transportation infrastructure and aim at carrying
out day-to-day protective and repair measures to limit degradation due to natural processes (e.g., weather) or
imposed processes (e.g., traffic). Maintenance functions include pavement management, shoulder maintenance,
bridge inspection, vegetation management, road weather management, work zone management, and asset
management.

C. How are Extreme Weather Events and Climate Change Related?
It is important to understand how extreme weather events and climate change are related and how they
differ.5 Changes in climate and weather are linked over the long term, but no single weather event can
specifically be attributed to a changing climate.
 Weather events are defined as the state of the atmosphere in a particular location at a particular time. For
example, rain, temperature, and wind are all aspects of local weather. “Extreme weather events can
include significant anomalies in temperature, precipitation and winds, and can manifest as heavy
precipitation and flooding, heatwaves, drought, wildfires and windstorms (including tornadoes and
tropical storms).” 6
 Climate change refers to any significant change in the measures of climate lasting for an extended
period of time. Climate change includes major variations in temperature, precipitation, or wind
patterns, among other environmental conditions, that occur over several decades or longer. Changes in
climate may manifest as a rise in sea level, as well as increase the frequency and magnitude of extreme
weather events now and in the future.7
Long-term trends in climate are not dependent on any single extreme event. A single large rain event or
even a single wet year may just be a normal fluctuation in weather patterns but changes that are noted year
after year, such as a run of wet years, can be attributed to a larger change in the climate.
Climate change could mean that what was historically a rare weather event becomes increasingly frequent
(possibly shifting from rare to occasional or regular). Consideration of how we respond effectively or not
to the rare extreme events occurring today can provide useful information about how we can and should
respond to increasing future risk. Optimizing for today’s extreme weather events makes our systems more
prepared for the increased frequency of some events that is anticipated under a changing climate. Figure 3
demonstrates the shift in temperatures towards more hot weather and a slight decrease in cold weather.

A good discussion of the linkage between extreme weather events and climate change can be found in: D. Huber and J. Gulledge,
“Extreme Weather and Climate Change: Understanding the Link and Managing the Risk,” Science and Impacts Program (Arlington, VA:
Center for Climate and Energy Solutions, 2011). Available at: http://www.c2es.org/publications/extreme-weather-and-climate-change.

D. How Will Climate Change Affect Transportation Systems Management
and Operations and Maintenance?
As climate changes, agencies may have to deal with new weather stressors that require different planning
approaches or responses (e.g., loss of permafrost in Alaska, snow and ice control in Southern states). The
2011 report, Adapting Transportation to the Impacts of Climate Change State of the Practice provided an
overview of the operational impacts associated with climate change.9 These operational impacts include:
 Increase in traffic incident management activities.
 Road and lane closures.
 Reduced (and variable) speed limit.
 Disruption of transit service.
 Road and transit diversions.
 Truck restrictions.
 Work zone management (to accommodate additional lane closures).
The 2013 report, Planning for Systems Management & Operations as part of Climate Change Adaptation,
provides a summary of the anticipated changes to system maintenance (e.g., inspection, frequency of repairs,
need for “quick maintenance” patrols); system operations practices and strategies (e.g., more frequent
diversion to more robust alternate routes); travel behavior (e.g., motivation to use alternate modes of transport
such as transit, biking, or walking); and freight transportation (dynamic or seasonal restrictions for trucks or
rail during times of high heat) needed or likely to occur as a result of anticipated impacts of climate change.10

While TSMO and maintenance programs are often reactive by nature, the accelerating pace and
increasingly unpredictable nature of extreme weather events could place increasing strain on an already
stressed system. Further, agencies may not be optimized for the present; some practices need to be
improved now.
TSMO and maintenance programs will need to take a proactive approach to regularly reevaluate existing
programs and practices in light of new information and criteria (e.g., if preparing for new demands, they
may need to adjust budgets) to ensure they are climate resilient. Opposition to making changes in
operations may exist due to the risk-averse environments under which many State DOTs operate.
Traditionally, this risk aversion has resulted in slow changes in practices and protocols in order to avoid
changing what works. Transportation agencies could be at greater risk, however, if they do not change their
practices rather than if they do. The environment in which they work is changing due to climate change;
risk-averse decision makers should seek to avoid risks by considering climate change in their systems
management and maintenance rather than ignoring it.

E. Why Do Transportation Systems Management and Operations and
Maintenance Programs Need to Adapt to Climate Change?
TSMO and maintenance programs have vital roles to play in adapting to climate change. For many of the
already observed and anticipated weather events related to climate change, TSMO and maintenance
workers as well as the DOT emergency responders with whom they coordinate—who are, in some
instances, DOT maintenance staff—are and will be the public face and the front-line of the response.
Climate change presents a business risk for transportation agencies. Without proactive steps to anticipate
potential changes and respond to them, the ability of agencies to support their core mission could be
compromised.
With climate change comes uncertainty, be it in a greater variability of expected events or unexpected
extreme weather. By not understanding the risk or not assessing the vulnerability of their operations,
agencies can be caught off-guard by an unexpected event leading to significantly degraded capabilities
when they are most needed.
Changes in relatively short duration extreme events often result in the most significant consequences, and
while DOTs may be prepared to respond to these events on an individual basis, the cumulative impact of
more severe and more frequent events may warrant a change in business practices. Longer term changes to
annual or seasonal averages, which are often cited in broad-scale summaries of projected climate change,
cause less immediate impacts but over time can affect practices and costs.
Not all the necessary adjustments to business practices are radical; there are many ways—big and
small—to account for climate change and reduce this business risk. In fact, many TSMO and maintenance
adaptations will be the “low-hanging fruit” to prepare DOTs for climate change, in contrast to changes to
infrastructure design.
Incremental steps toward a more comprehensive program that fully considers how to incorporate potential
climate change impacts will be easier for most agencies to manage than an immediate, full-fledged,
comprehensive overhaul of their existing programs. A phased implementation approach will enable
agencies to adapt their TSMO and maintenance programs to climate change in a planned and systematic
manner. For this to occur, it is necessary to incorporate the needs of climate change and extreme weather
events into the routine policy and practice of TSMO and maintenance at transportation agencies.

8

Adapting TSMO and maintenance programs is largely about improving capability rather than a major
technology development and deployment initiative. Many of the technology elements used to support
safety, congestion mitigation, and traveler information objectives are already in place and there is more on
the way. For example, today Road Weather Information Systems (RWIS), cameras, and other roadside
infrastructure are used extensively by agencies around the country. In the near future, connected vehicle
technologies promise to overcome the barriers of fixed infrastructure and data availability. To adapt to
climate change then, agencies need to consider how these existing capabilities need to evolve to meet the
new and emerging requirements of a changing climate. These may take the form of hardening the
communication links or rethinking the siting of these detection systems. Similarly, other existing
processes for supporting safety and reliability need to be reviewed and supplemented to account for
climate change.

F. Capability Maturity Framework
The American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) and FHWA have
developed a capability maturity framework (CMF) to help DOTs adapt their TSMO programs.11 The CMF
defines six areas of capability that form the supportive foundation for the implementation of TSMO
strategies. As agency capabilities increase from ad-hoc implementation and planning to optimized
practices, agencies will be able to have repeatable processes that are scalable, sustainable, and
mainstreamed.
This guide aligns those actions needed to adapt TSMO and maintenance programs to climate change with
the six areas of the CMF:
 Business processes – including financial (e.g., budgeting) as well as conducting risk analyses and dealing
with uncertainty, planning, programming, and standard operating/implementation procedures.
 Systems and technology – transportation agencies have invested in a wide suite of technology and
management systems to enable them to more efficiently manage weather events within their jurisdiction.
 Performance measurement – including measures definition, data acquisition, analysis, and utilization.
 Culture – including technical understanding, leadership commitment, policy, outreach, and program
authority.
 Organization and workforce – including organizational structure, staff capacity, development, and
retention.
 Collaboration – including internal collaboration and relationships with other public agencies and the
private sector.

G. What's Already Being Done?
The growing awareness that climate change can affect transportation has not yet resulted in widespread
actions to identify and implement strategies to address climate change. Some transportation agencies have
begun to assess vulnerability. Fewer have moved beyond vulnerability assessments and into adaptation
planning. Even fewer have implemented adaptation strategies and begun to evaluate their effectiveness.
Further, more emphasis to date has been on the implications of climate change for infrastructure planning,
design, and engineering with less focus on system management, operations, and maintenance.
The transportation sector is not ahead or behind other sectors in this regard. Changes in climate are often
discussed on a global or regional scale and presented with wide ranges of uncertainty and timescales. It is
challenging to understand what climate change will mean on a local scale and for the timeframe most
relevant to specific decision making processes of interest.

III. Steps to Adapt Transportation
Systems Management and Operations and
Maintenance Programs to Climate Change
A. How Transportation Systems Management and Operations and
Maintenance Work Together on Climate Change
Over the past 10 years, State and local agencies have implemented various transportation systems
management and operations (TSMO) and maintenance strategies to mitigate the impacts of adverse
weather on the transportation system. The strategies run the gamut from plowing and sanding to
coordinated traffic control strategies and regional traveler information. Agencies respond to weather events
through a multi-pronged approach that involves a combination of operational, maintenance, and, at times,
emergency management strategies. Typical strategies used today include motorist alerts, advisories,
warnings (which include roadside active warning systems and pre-trip traveler information systems), speed
restrictions (variable speed limits, for example), vehicle restrictions (truck restrictions during high winds),
route restrictions (road closures), anti-icing/deicing road surface treatments, plowing, and traffic signal
management (weather responsive traffic management). In addition, traffic incident and emergency
management practices provide agencies with the ability to marshal resources effectively to address adverse
weather. Most of these approaches require multi-agency and multi-disciplinary capabilities to be brought
together efficiently before, during, and after the extreme weather event. Traffic incident and emergency
management collectively fall under the area of emergency transportation operations (ETO), which involves
collaboration and coordination between transportation, public safety (fire, rescue, emergency medical
service [EMS]), law enforcement) and emergency management communities.
The roles and responsibilities of TSMO, maintenance, and emergency response managers and staff are
connected and often interdependent in addressing the impacts of extreme weather and climate change on
the transportation system. Each functional group has a unique set of decisions falling across the six areas
of the capability maturity framework (CMF) (described in Section II) that may need to be examined in
adapting to climate change.

11

For example, the managers of maintenance programs will be concerned with decisions involving
pavement rehabilitation needs and methods, bridge maintenance needs and methods, construction and
maintenance work timelines and timeframes, and vegetation control. TSMO12program managers will
need to revisit other decisions such as the types of monitoring equipment and sources, communication
needs, and siting criteria necessary to obtain real-time operational information on the transportation
system and push information out to travelers. Emergency management leaders, in coordination with
operations divisions, will look at adapting operating procedures and resource levels to prepare for
hurricane evacuations or other weather-related emergencies. As is evident, TSMO functions rely on
well-maintained infrastructure, and successful emergency management depends on reliable and
strategically deployed TSMO infrastructure (e.g., traffic signals, contra-flow lanes, variable message sign
(VMS), cameras, road weather information stations), TSMO staff, and fine-tuned operating procedures
that can be leveraged during emergencies. The same holds true for maintenance, its infrastructure, and
the linkage between maintenance and emergency management.
The link between transportation operations and emergency management varies depending on the scale of
the event. During major, catastrophic events emergency management agencies have control of the response
and transportation operations. During less extreme events, the departments of transportation (DOTs)
maintain control over the highways and major arterials. This difference will be important to consider when
DOTs plan actions to address climate change risks in the short and long term. Figure 4 illustrates that as
the level of severity of the incident increases, the number of agencies involved grows beyond the DOT to
include public safety and emergency management agencies. The increase in severity also indicates that a
greater level of collaboration and communication between agencies and functions is required.

B. Overview of an Operations Adaptation Framework
The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) has developed and tested a Climate Change and Extreme
Weather Vulnerability Assessment Framework (“the Framework”) (see Figure 5) which consists of a report13
and an online virtual framework (see Figure 6),14 which serve both as a guide and a collection of resources
for use by transportation professionals when analyzing the impacts of climate change and extreme weather
on transportation infrastructure. Its purpose is to identify key considerations, questions, and resources that
can be used to design and implement a climate change vulnerability assessment. To date, the Framework
has been tested by 24 pilot sites and has undergone a series of refinements as a result of the real-world
findings. The pilots have also contributed to the plentiful body of lessons learned and example resources
that are linked to the virtual version of the Framework.

The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) Virtual Framework
FHWA has developed a broad set of resources to help transportation agencies prepare for climate
change. The "Virtual Framework for Vulnerability Assessment" website houses resources for State and
local transportation agencies (see Figure 6). The Virtual Framework breaks the vulnerability
assessment process into six modules. Each module contains step-by-step guidance, video testimonials
from professionals sharing lessons on their experience, case studies related to the framework step,
links to resources related to the step, and tools to help a user complete the step.

Figure 6. Screenshot. Federal Highway Administration Virtual Framework
for Vulnerability Assessment (Module 2 shown).
This guide is intended to complement the resources on the Virtual Framework and provide targeted
guidance to staff in the transportation systems management and operations (TSMO) and maintenance
domains. Throughout this document, the Virtual Framework is referenced as appropriate, in cases
where guidance (e.g., where to find climate data) is not operations-specific.
The Framework, originally developed with an infrastructure planning and design focus, provides the
organizing principle for understanding adaptation needs from an operations and maintenance perspective
as well.
Consistent with the Framework the primary components of this guide include:
 Define objectives and scope.
 Assess vulnerability.
 Integrate climate change considerations into decision making.
 Monitor, revisit, and develop new objectives.
While the emphasis of this guide is on concrete actions DOTs can take to integrate climate change into
decision making, it is critical to also define the scope of adaptation efforts and assess vulnerabilities to
inform the development of adaptation strategies. Figure 7 illustrates how TSMO and maintenance
groups can use the Framework to identify and implement appropriate strategies for their unique
conditions and locations.

C. Define Scope
It is important to articulate the objectives of the adaptation effort up front and identify the anticipated
changes in climate that are most relevant to your agency. Together, these steps frame the scope of the
planning effort and drive the details required; they help minimize data collection and analysis activities that
would ultimately be extraneous to the desired objectives.

1. Articulate Program Goals and Operations Objectives
TSMO and maintenance offices within agencies have long been driven by goals and objectives largely
around safety, levels of service, and reliability. DOTs need to adapt to climate change to ensure they can
continue to meet program goals.
Program goals and operations objectives may require some updates when anticipated climate changes are
taken into account. These updates may be only subtle shifts in agency focus, but should aim to define
what must be achieved to ensure resilient operations. Agencies should consider what levels of performance
are expected during adverse weather (which may become more frequent or intense under a changing
climate) and what levels of disruption are tolerable. Demand-oriented goals and objectives (e.g., the role of
the agency. in serving the surge in demand that may be expected) need to be defined as well as the
expectations for restoration of services and travel.
15

Getting Started: Obtaining Buy-In
A critical component to any organizational change is developing support for that change among key
decision makers and stakeholders. Adapting a transportation systems management and operations
(TSMO) or maintenance program to increase climate change resiliency requires gathering support
among program management, agency decision makers, program staff, and others involved in the
TSMO or maintenance program activities. The level of buy-in required will depend on the scale of
change desired. Below are several recommendations for gathering support for adapting a TSMO or
maintenance program to prepare for the current and potential future impacts of climate change:
 Make the business case for resilience.
• Start by identifying any current issues in operating and maintaining the transportation system
as a result of extreme weather events or noticeable changes in climate.
• Use FHWA documents, such as the Regional Climate Change Effects: Useful Information for
Transportation Agencies, to gather key reasons to be concerned about climate change and what
the projected effects are of climate change locally.15
• Find a model or example to strengthen the case. The Federal Highway Admintration (FHWA)
has several case studies available.
 Engage staff and leadership throughout the department of transportation (DOT) early and often,
especially in the vulnerability assessment and brainstorming of adaptation strategies.
 Establish clear roles and responsibilities for individuals within the organization and determine
systems for accountability.
 Improve integration of TSMO, maintenance, and emergency management into DOT planning for
climate change.
Agencies should also develop more specific, outcome-based operations objectives for the program goals.
These operations objectives should be refined and tied to specific performance measures when working
through Sections III.D. Assess Vulnerability and III.E Integrate into Decision Making (and once the user
has a better understanding of realistic expectations that take into account future changes in climate).15

2. Identify Key Climate Variables
Changes in climate and extreme weather events will not be uniform throughout the world or even
throughout the United States. It is important to identify the climate stressors or extreme weather events
(e.g., increase in extreme heat, more frequent heavy precipitation, increased precipitation variability,
drought, flooding, sea level rise, higher storm surges, increase in wildfire probability) that: (1) could
occur locally; and (2) could affect local TSMO and maintenance programs. Examples of the geographic
diversity of climate impacts can be seen in Figure 8. A complete set of resources for identifying local
climate changes is available as part of Module 2 of FHWA’s Virtual Framework for Vulnerability
Assessment.16 Once the regional climate stressors of concern have been identified, Section III of this
document explains how to refine DOTs understanding of the scale and impacts of those climate stressors
on TSMO and maintenance.

3. Develop Information on Decisions
Sensitive to Climate Change
As discussed in Section III.D.2, information on the
past climate and the resultant impacts is useful for
understanding the kinds of weather and climate
effects to which assets and operations are sensitive
and can help to identify thresholds beyond which
future climate effects may affect those assets.

Sensitivity = how an asset or system
fares when it is exposed to an
impact.
Source: Federal Highway Administration Virtual
Adaptation Framework.

It is also important to look forward and identify decisions that may be climate-sensitive in the future and
which decisions (e.g., standard operating practices, budget allocations) may be based on historical climate
trends that no longer accurately reflect more recent trends (that have shifted due to climate change).
The following is a proposed definition for climate-sensitive decisions:

Decisions are climate-sensitive if their continued effectiveness
could be compromised by projected changes in climatic conditions
(e.g., changes in temperature, precipitation, weather patterns, and
the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events).
TSMO and maintenance decisions that DOTs make on a daily basis are rarely climate-sensitive, because
the implications of those decisions are typically so short-lived that there is not enough time for them to be
compromised by the effects of climate change. Transportation agencies make numerous short-term and
long-term decisions about their TSMO and maintenance programs, however. Potential changes in
extreme weather events or climate variability are relevant to many of these decisions, especially the
decisions agencies make infrequently.

An early step in identifying how DOTs can adapt their TSMO and maintenance programs is to identify
possible entry points—existing decisions that could incorporate climate change considerations in the
future. For example, knowing that there could be more frequent flooding events could change an agency’s
decision about what workforce capabilities are required for the season. Table 1 provides an example of
potential TSMO and maintenance decisions which may be influenced by climate change and extreme
weather. Additional examples and related information are provided in Appendix A – Matrix of ClimateSensitive Decisions. For each decision, the appendix includes a description, how climate stressors affect
the decision, and which climate stressors affect the decision.
Table 1. Example of Climate-Sensitive Decisions.
Climate-Sensitive
Decision Areas

Specific Decisions

Description

1. Planning for future
workforce needs.

Determine the right level of
workforce requirements and
capabilities.

Operating agencies make a variety of
workforce-related decisions, including the
number of staff required, their locations, and
capabilities necessary to monitor, control,
report, and maintain the roadway system.

2. Planning for
operations and
maintenance
investments.

Determine criteria to
prioritize operational
resource investments
(including capital
improvements).

Resource investments may include new capital
improvements for operations and maintenance
such as control systems, field equipment,
vehicles, communications, and power. They
may also include investments for annual
maintenance.

3. Budgeting for
operations and
maintenance.

Determine the appropriate
funding needs and levels on
annual and multi-year basis.

Operating agencies typically are funded on an
annual basis. Funding levels greatly drive the
overall program capabilities and functions.

4. Establishing
realistic objectives.

Set regional operations
objectives for the program.

Effective planning for operations requires a
clear articulation of regional operations
objectives. These objectives define the
response strategies and the performance-based
management required.

Note: Excerpted from Appendix A – Matrix of Climate-Sensitive Decisions.

While day-to-day management of traffic operations might not be particularly sensitive to broader changes
in climate, the planning required to support agile TSMO and maintenance programs may involve more
climate-sensitive decisions. For example, future workforce equipment needs, facility siting, material
procurement, technology deployments, business processes, and institutional arrangements typically span
multiple seasons and even years. The effectiveness of such decisions made today may be compromised by
changes in climate.
The following list of questions can help agencies determine if a decision is climate-sensitive:
 Do climate variables have a direct effect on the decision outcomes? For example, will increases in
precipitation overwhelm current maintenance practices?
 Can climate variables affect the underlying assumptions upon which the decision is founded? For
example, will changes in the climate, such as precipitation, affect traffic levels, which in turn impact
roadway operations and management?
 Is climate likely to change during the time period governed by the decision? Consider long-term, chronic
changes in climate as well as the increased frequency of acute weather events.
• What is the time horizon for planning and implementation?
• How frequently is the decision made?
18

 Is this a single decision moment or a multiple decision moment (i.e., is the decision made once and then
executed or is there room for refinement and adjustment over the course of implementation/operations)?
Includes:
• Financial reversibility (i.e., does the practice represent a cost that cannot be recovered?)
• Foreclosure of other options (i.e., does implementing this practice limit the availability of other practices
in the future?).
In addition, think about whether there are any specific weather thresholds at which the decisions become
sensitive. Linking TSMO and maintenance practices to weather thresholds is a needed step in this process.
To date, these rules have been ad-hoc and not formalized. In the past, experienced supervisors knew what
activities could be scheduled based on weather conditions like precipitation, wind speeds, visibility, and
temperature. There are no standard weather-related practices for maintenance or operations actions. When
there are specific thresholds for weather conditions (e.g., staff cannot work without frequent breaks when
temperatures are above X°F), projections on how those specific variables may change in the future can
help inform planning.

Identifying Weather Sensitivity Thresholds
An important component of understanding how climate change may affect transportation systems
management and operations (TSMO) and maintenance practices is understanding whether there are
specific weather thresholds that affect TSMO and maintenance—and then, whether those thresholds may
change in the future.
The links between weather, TSMO, and maintenance are often well understood at the individual level (e.g.,
maintenance supervisors), but these “rules” are often ad hoc and are rarely documented or formalized.
Consider using the climate change planning process to capture internal guidelines and weather
thresholds. For example, the table below can serve as a “template” for identifying and recording weather
sensitivity thresholds. This is derived for work focused on the Illinois and Iowa departments of
transportation. The Capital Area Metropolitan Planning Organization (CAMPO) in Austin, Texas,
completed a similar exercise to identify sensitivity thresholds as part of their Federal Highway
Administration-funded Climate Resilience Pilot Project.

Using Scenario Planning to Understand Climate Change Vulnerability and Risk
Scenario planning is an approach to planning that is increasingly being used by transportation planning
organizations to make critical decisions in the face of uncertainty. Scenario planning helps stakeholders
answer questions such as what are the policies, strategies, or investments that help us achieve our goals in
light of uncontrollable or unknown future conditions. Scenario planning brings together interagency and
intra-agency stakeholders needed to effectively address an issue and helps them make decisions that are
more robust in a variety of futures. It also helps create a more adaptive, resilient organization or program.
Scenario planning could be used to help make decisions regarding adapting a transportation systems
management and operations (TSMO) or maintenance program for potential climate change impacts.
Scenario planning allows organizations to explore several distinct possible futures that may result from
different paths that climate change may take, analyze the potential consequences, and investigate
alternative TSMO and maintenance strategies to address the issues. The scenario approach formalizes
the consideration of uncertainty in preparing for climate change impacts in a systematic way. Scenario
planning may also aid in helping to set expectations among planners and even the general public on
acceptable levels of system performance under extreme conditions by assessing the trade-offs between
levels of investment and levels of system operation during different levels of severe weather. Finally, the
scenario process might also aid the region in better understanding its areas of susceptibility, thereby
further helping to refine and strategically deploy TSMO and maintenance strategies.
There are models (e.g., Maintenance Decision Support System [MDSS]; Sea, Lake, and Overland Surges
from Hurricanes [SLOSH]) that can be can be used to run extreme future event scenarios. These model
runs could be used to inform a planning process that considers high heat, winter storms, summer storms,
sea level rise, wildfires, or cascading impacts (e.g., power/utility failure, landslides).

D. Assess Vulnerability
The level of vulnerability assessment needed – high-level or detailed, qualitative or quantitative, statewide
or localized, agency-wide or by departments – will vary based on the types of decisions required.
Regardless of the exact process used, the following are key elements of a vulnerability assessment.

1. Document Existing Capabilities
It is important to take a look at current or baseline capabilities (assessing both technical as well as
institutional capability to respond to climate and extreme weather) before seeking to determine
improvements in those capabilities (discussed in Section III.E.4). The CMF provides a useful framework for
assessing and documenting existing institutional capabilities (and will be discussed again later in the context
of determining improvement in capabilities necessary for successful implementation of adaptation
measures). The framework defines capability in terms of six areas that together inform the agency’s overall
ability to respond to changing conditions: business processes, systems and technology, performance
management, culture, organization and workforce, and collaboration. Documenting current capabilities and
identifying where those capabilities fall on the spectrum of ad-hoc implementation to planning for

20

optimized practices will help an agency gain a better sense of how resilient they may already be to climate
change and extreme weather events.

2. Collect and Integrate Data on Past Performance
Examining previous vulnerabilities can be an excellent starting point for thinking about future
vulnerabilities. Common climate change-related TSMO and maintenance program vulnerabilities include:
 Loss of roadway capacity.
 Loss of alternative routes.
 Loss of situational awareness (due to power/communication).
 Inability to evacuate/shelter-in-place.
 Loss of service life (due to faster deterioration, etc.).
 Increased safety risk.
 Loss of economic productivity.
 Reduced mobility.
Internal records or other data on how the system has fared during previous extreme weather events can
provide a rich source of insights into potential future vulnerabilities. Any of the following could be a source
of information about system vulnerabilities:
 Traffic incident reports – Check whether there were any incidents during specific recent extreme
weather events that correspond to the climate stressors under evaluation (e.g., heat waves, heavy rain
events, tropical storms).
 Maintenance records – Check maintenance records for the time surrounding specific recent weather
events.
 After-action reports –These reports, compiled after extreme weather events, describe what happened,
why, and areas for improvement. Mine these reports for information about vulnerabilities for
applicable weather events.
 Emergency reimbursement forms – For declared disasters relevant to the climate stressors under
evaluation, review Federal Emergency Management Administration (FEMA) or other emergency
reimbursement requests to identify the magnitude and scope of damages during past events.
 Staff interviews across departments – On-the-ground staff at DOTs often have deep institutional
knowledge about existing vulnerabilities that may not be well-documented. Asking staff “What keeps
you up at night?” can help facilitate discussion about key system vulnerabilities.19

Mining Agency Institutional Knowledge for Vulnerability Assessments
Washington State DOT (WSDOT) completed a statewide climate change vulnerability assessment in
2011. Their vulnerability assessment focused on asset-level vulnerabilities, but the approach would be
transferrable to transportation systems management and operations (TSMO) and maintenance
vulnerabilities. The WSDOT assessment relied on a series of workshops with WSDOT staff, including
district maintenance supervisors and their staff. They asked “What keeps you up at night?” and had staff
individually rate each asset’s vulnerability on a scale of 1 to 10. Lower scores corresponded to reduced
capacity or temporary operational failure, while higher scores corresponded to complete asset failure.

If possible, build a dataset to correlate past extreme weather disruptions—gathered from the above
sources—with information on the weather conditions associated with the event.
Local National Weather Service (NWS) Forecast Offices (there are 122 nationwide) house “Weather Event
Archives” that can be very useful sources of information on past extreme events.20 It is also important to
share collected information across offices or departments.

Getting Started: Strategies for Documenting Institutional Knowledge
On-the-ground staff at departments of transportation (DOTs) are largely aware of the current weatherrelated problems they face on a regular basis. In addition, they are valuable resources in discussing
hypothetical extreme weather scenarios, and may be able to readily identify potential points of failure.
Below are several possible mechanisms to collect and document the valuable institutional knowledge of
staff, which can then be leveraged to improve planning for transportation systems management and
operations (TMSO) and maintenance in the face of climate change.
 Conduct interviews with staff to document their knowledge of vulnerabilities. Interview questions can
include:
• Recall [a recent severe weather event]. How did that affect your purview?
• When you have advance warning of an extreme [summer storm/winter storm/hurricane/heat
event]:
◦ What responses are triggered? Are those responses tied to any thresholds in event severity
(e.g., only if there is more than 3” of snow)?
◦ What personnel are involved?
◦ What contractors are put on notice in the preparations?
◦ What materials and equipment are put on standby?
•

When the event is over:
∘∘ What inspections/audits are conducted to evaluate impacts?
∘∘ How are corrective actions planned?

 In a workshop setting, have staff place pins or dots on a map of the transportation system to identify
locations with frequent weather-related issues (e.g., flooding, potholes).
 Establish regular debriefs to bring together the department’s cross-cutting (or multi-disciplinary)
teams to discuss weather-related issues. Designate a person to take notes during the meeting and write
down what works well, what does not, and what needs to change to make the system more resilient.
 Establish transition plans for retiring staff. Ask them to write down their regular duties, habits, and
unwritten expertise.

3. Develop Climate Inputs
In addition to gathering information on past weather disruptions and identifying key TSMO and
maintenance weather sensitivities, another important component of a climate change vulnerability
assessment is collecting data, qualitative or quantitative, on how climate stressors are projected to change
locally. The focus should be on identifying how specific weather thresholds identified as currently
affecting TSMO and maintenance activities may change in the future.

20 Historical Weather Event Archives are not always easy to find on NWS Regional Forecast Office web pages, but are usually housed under
the Climate section.
22

Several sources exist to provide information on potential future climate changes, a selection of which are
highlighted in the following text box. See Module 4 of the FHWA Framework21 for additional guidance on
gathering climate inputs.

In addition to collecting information on climate projections, many transportation agencies have found it
helpful to collect information on historical weather conditions in order to provide context for the
projections. Examine Road Weather Information System (RWIS) data to help establish the climate record
for the area. All properly sited and maintained weather stations can be a vital part of the climate record,
especially if they have been maintained for longer than 30 years. If RWIS data is not available, data can be
obtained from the local weather station(s) through the National Weather Service.

Understanding Uncertainty
Future climate change is dependent upon the amount of global greenhouse gasses emitted. In the near
term, it is easier to predict emission levels because they will likely be similar to today’s rate of emissions
production given the limited time for society to evolve. It is very difficult to project emission levels out
50 to 90 years into the future because it is not known how our global society will evolve over time (e.g.,
population growth, economic growth, energy use, development of significant technological
advancements, political action mitigating emissions). Thus, the range of plausible future emissions
expands over future time, along with the plausible range of climate responses.

PRESENT

Uncertainty Over Time

DISTANT FUTURE

Figure 9. Diagram. Increase in Uncertainty Over Time.
Near term climate projections have a tighter range of possibilities, while distant climate projections have
wider range of possibilities.
Any projections of future climate conditions are subject to this uncertainty, but that doesn’t have to
prevent agencies from using this information. Scenario planning exercises can help departments of
transportation identify adaptation strategies that increase resilience in a range of potential future
conditions (see text box on page 23).

4. Characterize Impacts and Risks
Synthesize information on potential climate changes, past impacts, and known sensitivities to characterize
possible impacts of climate change on TSMO and maintenance programs.
Determine Outputs
Think about how results will be used to determine what level of information is needed to inform decisions.
Options include:
 Qualitative vulnerability ratings of individual decisions, functions, components, or locations (the level
of detail decided at the outset) – e.g., High, Medium, Low vulnerabilities. In this approach, consider
vulnerability as a function of three components:22
• Exposure – The nature and degree to which a system or asset is exposed to significant climate
variations (i.e., whether and how climate stressors will change).
• Sensitivity – Degree to which an asset or system is affected by exposure (i.e., if all assets were
equally exposed, which would experience the greatest damage?).
• Adaptive Capacity – Ability of a system to adjust, repair, and respond to damage or disruption.
Adaptive capacity may not be applicable or ratable in many cases, so it may be excluded from
vulnerability assessments.
Figure 10 provides an example of a rapid qualitative assessment of the vulnerability of a pavement
maintenance program to increasing temperatures. It assumes that no information is readily available on
adaptive capacity for this rapid assessment (i.e., that more information might need to be gathered to assess
that component if a more detailed assessment is determined to be useful).

 Quantitative vulnerability ratings – Use a quantitative approach to assign vulnerability ratings based on
exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity. For example, define and quantify sensitivity in terms of
potential impact (e.g., costs, delays, disruptions).
 Qualitative risk ratings –Identify “risks” rather than “vulnerabilities.” The concepts are similar, but risk
is different in that it incorporates likelihood of potential impact.
• Risk is traditionally defined as the product of likelihood and consequence. Likelihood is parallel to
the exposure component of vulnerability, and consequence is parallel to sensitivity.
• Likelihood of potential impacts can be very difficult to evaluate, given the uncertainties inherent in
climate projections. However, some agencies are more familiar with the concept of “risk” than
vulnerabilities, so choose to present risk ratings.
 Quantitative risk ratings – Use a quantitative approach to calculate risk of impacts.
Determine Approach
Regardless of the intended outputs, there are three primary options for how to determine those outputs.
 Data-driven, desktop analysis – Compile and assess data on climate projections and past impacts of
weather events to determine future impacts of climate change.
 Workshop-based, stakeholder-driven analysis – Engage staff and other stakeholders to qualitatively
assess vulnerabilities or risks. For example, ask staff to identify the locations most susceptible to flooding,
or the hypothetical consequences of different climate scenarios.
 Hybrid approach – Complete a desktop analysis with available data, and “ground truth” the results with
stakeholders through workshops, one-on-one interviews, or other mechanisms to get their feedback.
See the “Getting Started” boxes below for checklists to follow, along with tools and materials to evaluate
climate change vulnerabilities or risks.

Washington State DOT
(WSDOT) Vulnerability
Assessment Workshops
WSDOT identified a strategic goal to
“identify WSDOT facilities
vulnerable to the effects of climate
change and to evaluate and identify
possible strategies to reduce risk.” As
part of an FHWA pilot program,
WSDOT developed a structured,
stakeholder-based approach to
qualitatively assess facility risk. The
project team held 14 workshops in all
regions of the state in which WSDOT
staff rated all State-owned highways
and other transportation assets for
climate vulnerability. In the
workshops, participants used asset
maps, climate scenarios, and their
local knowledge to assess
vulnerability.
At the start of each workshop, the
project team presented a video about
climate impacts on infrastructure,
climate change scenarios for the state,
and impact maps. A GIS specialist
was on hand to overlay detailed asset
inventories with climate impact data.
Workshop participants then used a
qualitative scoring system to assess
roadway segments (or other assets)
for criticality and to rate the effect
that projected changes in climate
would have on WSDOT
infrastructure.
The total number of workshop
participants exceeded 200, including
maintenance staff; regional office
staff; and state ferry, aviation, and
rail system managers.

E. Integrate into Decision Making
1. Identify Performance Measures
Performance measurement can help to measure qualitative and quantitative progress towards meeting the
objectives of TSMO and maintenance programs. Performance measures can also help decision makers in
determining how to spend their limited budgets by focusing expenditures towards specific operational
issues in order to help them improve their performance metric scoring. Many DOTs have adopted or are in
the process of developing performance measures.23 If a DOT desires to become more resilient to the
impacts of climate change, it is important to integrate that desire into performance measures to ensure that
progress toward that goal is tracked over time.
The concept of climate change adaptation and resiliency can either be integrated into existing performance
measures or adopted as a stand-alone measure. Good measures are defined in part by their ability to be
measurable, understandable, and meaningful.24

Integrating Climate Change into Existing Objectives
Florida Department of Transportation's 2060 Florida Transportation Plan outlines six overarching
goals: (1) Economic Competitiveness, (2) Community Livability, (3) Environmental Stewardship, (4)
Safety and Security, (5) Maintenance and Operations, and (6) Mobility and Connectivity. Within each
goal, the plan sets specific objectives. Under the fifth goal, “Maintain and operate Florida’s
transportation system proactively,” one of four objectives is “Reduce the vulnerability and increase the
resilience of critical infrastructure to the impacts of climate trends and events.” The plan outlines
implementation strategies and performance indicators for the goal.

DOTs should consider whether revisions to existing performance measures are necessary to
accommodate climate change. When setting or revising performance measures, it is important to work
with local communities to establish a tolerance level for disruption (i.e., the acceptable level of
operational performance if threat occurs) given the changes that are projected to occur due to climate
change. It will be critical to explain that in some ways TSMO objectives may become easier while in
other ways it may become harder (e.g., increased frequency and intensity of storm events). By using a
scenario planning process, it can be demonstrated that in some instances, it will be harder to maintain
historic levels of service (LOS) with more intense/frequent events and therefore the performance
measures may need to be revised to reflect the changing reality. During this outreach process, it will also
be valuable to discuss the public’s mounting expectations for faster responses and constant access to a
highly operational roadway system in order to emphasize the need to reach a common understanding of
reasonable levels of service during extreme weather events.

23 The FHWA Office of Operations has prepared multiple resources for agencies looking to develop and track performance measurement that
are relevant to TSMO. There resources are available at: http://www.ops.fhwa.dot.gov/perf_measurement/.

2. Identify Potential Adaptation Measures25
Adaptation strategies should be developed to address known vulnerabilities directly—either those already
experienced or those identified through a vulnerability assessment. By mapping the strategies to the
vulnerabilities, there is a direct link from problem to solution. Additionally, the strategies should be
developed to help achieve new or existing performance metrics.
Frequently, adaptation strategies can be identified by looking to best practices in other states or regions
that already experience more severe weather events. While the South may not be used to responding to ice
storms, their counterparts in the North can provide guidance on how to prepare for, respond to, and
recover from this type of event. This “climate shifting” is also true for extreme heat waves, flooding,
landslides, wildfires, and other climate stressors. To develop strategies, review examples and best practices
from other agencies and engage a diverse range of staff within the organization. The staff with longer
tenures frequently knows the issues that arise during extreme weather events and can identify solutions to
the problems.

The Alaska Department of Transportation & Public Facilities (ADOT&PF) is now
conducting anti-icing with salt brine in the City of Fairbanks and other parts of interior
Alaska. Historically, Fairbanks and interior roads would stay frozen from mid-fall to late
spring, but now thawing and freezing rain events have caused the ADOT&PF to perform
anti-icing, something never considered previously in the interior.
Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) recently invested in
improvements to wireless communications capabilities and communication
redundancies between traffic management centers (TMCs). The agency also filled in
communication gaps to ensure continuous communication across rural areas in the event
of an emergency.
Maryland State Highway Administration (MDSHA) has installed backup power supply
to three-quarters of its cameras and will have complete coverage by the middle of 2015.
The situational awareness gained through closed-circuit televisions (CCTVs) is critical
for maintaining public safety during severe weather. MDSHA also has back-up power
on traffic signals to avoid manual traffic direction.
State and local member organizations rely on the Transportation Operations
Coordinating Committee (TRANSCOM) regional coordinating body to lead multiagency coordination and communications, particularly during incidents or weather
events. The organization has developed redundant (duplicate and triplicate) data servers
and networks to ensure its information sharing systems can operate during an extreme
event such as Hurricane Sandy, even in case of power outages. TRANSCOM has two
server rooms and two server feeds within its offices, a backup in New Jersey, and a
disaster recovery site on the west coast.
ADOT&PF issued a policy directive on winter maintenance coordination that requires
all regions in the agency to assist in the event of an emergency, regardless of location.
Likewise, WSDOT effectively dissolves district lines within the organization when
responding to major events so that resources can be applied where they are most needed
across the state.
The maintenance division for Minnesota DOT (MnDOT) recently began working more
closely with the transportation operations centers (TOCs) to ensure that the TOCs are
fully utilizing the MnDOT road weather technology programs to help meet the
organization’s common goal of serving the needs of the freight, transit, and traveling
public communities.

Best Practices from the Field (Continued)
Wyoming
and Utah

Multiple
States

Both the Wyoming DOT and the Utah DOT have citizen reporting programs that allow
travelers to report back to the DOT on road conditions. This expands the DOT’s
awareness of hazardous road conditions on the network and helps the DOT provide
“fresher” traveler information to the public.
The Utah DOT uses the nation’s first road weather reporting smartphone application.
The FHWA Integrated Mobile Observations demonstration project involving multiple
States, including MnDOT and Michigan DOT (MDOT), is a technological advancement
that aims at improving resilience to extreme events. By using mobile data of
atmospheric conditions around the vehicles, operations and maintenance supervisors can
use real-time information to inform decisions about workforce deployment, road
closures, or appropriate treatments to use. The data will eventually be pushed to
connected vehicles for in-vehicle alerts.
Responding to more intense and frequent weather events requires additional staff.
WSDOT has recently begun using the National Guard when necessary for
transportation-related activities. They act as an extension of WSDOT and the
Washington State Patrol in assisting with road closures. WSDOT has found it important
to know which external resources are available (e.g., National Guard), what roles those
resources can serve, and how to access those resources quickly.

It is important to consider a diverse range of adaptation strategies to ensure that possible solutions, easy
and difficult, are considered. Strategies for TSMO and maintenance should include the following types:
 Policy-based changes – including guidance on incorporating climate change adaptation in TSMO and
maintenance programs.
 Built infrastructure measures – including construction of protective barriers, infrastructure hardening,
permanent or temporary infrastructure relocation, development of climate-resilient design standards and
retrofits, and green infrastructure.
 Operational approaches – promote avoidance or reduction of impacts, as well as rapid and effective
response to impacts as they occur.
 Adaptive management – tracks hazards, impacts, costs, and effectiveness of adaptations and postdisaster response to inform the aforementioned categories of adaptation. This type of disciplined tracking
of climate or weather impacts serves as an interim adaptation strategy to help both determine whether
and what adaptation actions are necessary as well as develop a quantitative basis for investments and/or
reimbursements. RWIS can be an important tool in tracking road weather conditions over time,
anticipating maintenance needs, and identifying areas in need of investment.
Table 6 provides examples of some phased adaptation strategies that agencies may wish to consider. Before
selecting any strategies, agencies should understand their own vulnerabilities and undertake a more robust
and location-specific adaptation strategy development process.

Table 6. Sample Adaptation Strategies and Time Frames.
Vulnerability

Response

Increased frequency of
extreme events may require
additional personnel to
monitor, control, report, and
respond to events. Changes in
long-term climate trends may
also change seasonal work
requirements (e.g., changes in
winter weather seasons,
construction timing, or
landscaping timing) and
necessitate additional or
unique staff expertise to
monitor and respond to new
types of climate events (e.g.,
snow storm in Atlanta).

Short-term: Train existing personnel on
the potential impacts of climate change and
how this may affect their roles and
responsibilities.

Extreme events and long-term
changes in climate can affect
resource requirements. For
example, increases in
temperature can increase
annual pavement maintenance
costs, or changes in freeze/
thaw cycles can increase
potholes. Changes in winter
weather and increasing weather
uncertainty could also affect
budgets.

Siting equipment in areas that
will be impacted by sea level
rise, ecological damage,
flooding, snowfall, or other
climatic events may damage
the infrastructure.

TSMO, Maintenance,
Emergency
Management

Medium-term: Increase the availability of
contract staff to assist during extreme
events. Develop memorandums of
understanding (MOUs) with other agencies
for equipment and staff sharing during
extreme weather events.
Long-term: Hire additional staff to keep
pace with increasing transportation
systems management and operations
(TSMO), maintenance, and emergency
management needs.
Short-term: Increase cost tracking to
respond to specific extreme weather events
(see Getting Started: Data Collection Best
Practices). Establish a “rainy-day” fund for
unexpectedly bad years.

Maintenance

Medium-term: Revise budgeting process
and protocols to account for recent trends
that may diverge from the historical
baseline.
Long-term: Work with meteorologists and
climatologists to develop a process for
taking anticipated future events into
account while budgeting and planning.
Short-term: Consider Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA) flood zone
maps (after confirming the relevant local
maps are up to date) or other similarly
informative maps when siting and
designing sites for equipment.
Medium-term: Include consideration of
future stressors (e.g., accelerated sea level
rise) when making decisions about siting
equipment. Consider changes (e.g.,
increasing freeboard requirements) to
accommodate more intense rainfall events.
Long-term: Shift investments to mobile
data sources (e.g., citizen reporters, snow
patrol reporting, mobile probes), which are
less likely to end up in harm’s way.

Medium-term: Expand the use of
technologies for pavement placing that
operate better under high temperatures, for
example, cold-in-place recycling, coarser
aggregate, or using ice or chilled water to
cool
the asphalt. Investigate other technologies
that are suited to faster construction during
adverse weather conditions.
Long-term: Consider revising the
construction season to start earlier and end
later due to increased temperatures. During
the height of summer, shift construction
work to early morning and evening hours.
Short-term: Increase vegetation control
within existing right-of-way.

3. Evaluate and Select Adaptation Measures
As with all transportation budgeting processes, it is unlikely that DOTs will be able to fund their entire
“wish-list” of adaptation strategies. In order to narrow the list of strategies to a prioritized list, it is useful
to use a systematic evaluation process.

In the development of its Adapting to Rising Tides study, the MTC used a series of steps to evaluate
and narrow the list of potential adaptation strategies. Using a screening exercise followed by a
qualitative assessment, the project team selected five strategies for further development.
The screening exercise included questions on the scale and replicability of the strategy, the barriers to
implementation, the urgency of action, and impacts on society/equity, environment, and economy.
The qualitative assessment used an ordinal ranking system to compare the financial, social,
environmental, and governance-related (e.g., funding, legal barriers) performance of the strategies.
As a last level of review, the project team used its professional experience to select a final set of
balanced strategies.
The final report, with documentation of the adaptation action selection process, can be found here:
http://files.mtc.ca.gov/pdf/MTC_ClmteChng_ExtrmWthr_Adtpn_Report_Final.pdf.
Some agencies may have established evaluation criteria for projects through other processes; if so, a
variation on those criteria may prove to be an effective communication tool. If no such criteria exist, the
following criteria may provide a useful starting point:
 Technical and Political Feasibility – how practical it is for a particular strategy to be implemented,
accounting for engineering, policy, legal, and insurance considerations?
 Cost and Benefits – what are the up-front costs of implementation and the ongoing operations and
maintenance costs? If implemented, what is the value of the damages from climate change that
would be avoided?

36

 Efficacy – if implemented, to what extent would the strategy reduce the risk?
 Flexibility – if implemented, how easy would it be to revise the strategy at a later date? What is the
adaptive management potential of the strategy?
 Sustainability – does the strategy advance the "triple bottom line” of sustainability (e.g., what are the
impacts to the economy, society, and the environment)?26

Co-Benefits of Adapting
Departments of transportation (DOTs) should identify and account for the benefits and co-benefits of
integrating specific adaptation strategies into transportation systems management and operations
(TSMO) programs. Generally, co-benefits are assessed at a qualitative level in order to help identify
“win-win” strategies that increase resiliency to climate change and help to achieve other program
objectives. Often, it is easier to obtain support for funding these types of solutions because they
accomplish multiple goals. For example, several DOTs have justified upsizing culverts by highlighting
the benefits for fish passage in addition to the increased capacity provided for increases in extreme
precipitation events.
Some examples of co-benefits include:
 Greenhouse gas mitigation.
 Decreased operating costs.
 Increased roadway safety.
 Sustainability (i.e., improvements to the economy, environment, or social equity).
 Improvements in other performance measures.
Depending on the needs of the DOT, the evaluation can be qualitative or quantitative in nature. A
qualitative evaluation process is generally sufficient for selecting priorities while a quantified evaluation
may be necessary in order to justify funding. A qualitative evaluation may use a simple three point or five
point scale (e.g., low, medium, high or positive, neutral, negative) or rely on a narrative description of the
pros and cons of the strategies. A quantitative evaluation can be more effective when competing for
funding because it enables an agency to show hard numbers about the benefits of the program.
Additionally, quantitative evaluation metrics (e.g., reduction in traffic delay) can be translated into financial
benefits to be used in an economic assessment of the strategy. In some cases, as with FEMA Hazard
Mitigation Funding, it is required to demonstrate the cost effectiveness of adaptation strategies before they
will be funded. For more information on cost effectiveness tools and resources, see the Additional
Resources section of this document.
While evaluation metrics are a useful tool for informing the decision making process, they should not be
the basis for the entire decision making process. The input of the staff who work on these programs on a
daily basis and of the decision makers who understand the needs of the community are also important
pieces of information to take into account during the strategy selection process. Additionally, it is
recommended that the total number of evaluation measures be kept to a small set of valued measures in
order to allow for the output to be digestible and meaningful.

26 In October of 2012, FHWA launched INVEST 1.0 (Infrastructure Voluntary Evaluation Sustainability Tool), a web-based tool that helps
transportation agencies incorporate sustainability considerations into their transportation programs and projects. The tool contains a
module focused on operations and maintenance that enables agencies to self-assess their operations and maintenance activities with regard
to sustainability. The tool is available online at: https://www.sustainablehighways.org.

Consider Implementation Time Frames in Prioritizing Strategies
Prioritize adaptation measures into short-term (0-5 years), medium-term (5-10 years), and long-term
(10+ years) actions based on both the urgency of adapting (how soon the department of transportation
(DOT) needs to implement the strategy to protect against the projected climate changes) and the time
period of implementation (how long it will take to implement the adaptation strategy based on planning,
funding, and construction/programming time). The matrix of Climate Sensitive Decisions in Appendix
A provides initial insight into the implementation time period by identifying the frequency with which
the decisions are made. See the following table for examples of how the time period for implementation
and the level of urgency could factor into strategy prioritization.

In addition, consider the existing repair and replacement cycle before implementing a stand-alone
project. Proactive measures often make sense for high-value assets or assets that would be
catastrophically damaged during extreme weather events, while continuous repair/maintenance (i.e.,
opportunistic adaptation efforts) is often the best approach for preparing for smaller, more frequent
events and for assets that are less vulnerable to climate change.

4. Determine Improvements in Capabilities Necessary for Successful Implementation
Successful implementation of adaptation measures may require more overarching enhancements to the
agency’s capabilities. As described in Section II.E. FHWA has developed a primer that outlines six
dimensions of capability that are closely associated with more effective TSMO activities (including those
related to reducing climate change impacts).27
Improvements in one or more of these capabilities may be necessary to successfully implement the
adaptation strategies discussed under “Identify Potential Adaptation Strategies.” Table 8 denotes which of
the above capabilities apply to a range of potential adaptation strategies.

F. Monitor and Revisit
Monitoring and evaluating helps keep adaptation efforts on track as new information on climate risks
emerges, evidence of the effectiveness of adaptation strategies becomes available, or other programmatic
changes occur. Monitoring and evaluating serve to assess progress toward goals and objectives. These
functions help an agency identify which activities are working well and which ones need to be refined.
The FHWA Framework describes the following steps as key to efforts to monitor and revisit: 28
 Establish a monitoring and evaluation plan.
 Engage stakeholders.
 Monitor and collect data on relevant indicators.
 Evaluate the project and its outcomes.
 Revisit.
TSMO and maintenance programs are flexible (much more so than infrastructure planning and design
decisions) and can evolve as conditions change.
28 FHWA Virtual Framework for Vulnerability Assessment, Available online at: http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/environment/climate_change/
adaptation/ongoing_and_current_research/gulf_coast_study/phase2_task6/page04.cfm.
41

Monitoring trends in extreme weather events (such as frequency of particular events as well as impacts on
TSMO and maintenance) and evaluating the effectiveness of actions will help to continually inform
decision making. Monitoring trends in extreme weather events, for example, can help decision makers
recognize when they need to manage for “new normal” conditions. As mentioned above, climate change
refers to significant variations in temperature, precipitation, wind patterns, and other measures of climate
lasting for an extended period of time. It may be decades before there is a robust enough set of data to
attribute changes in trends to climate change. Such attribution is not necessary, though, to recognize that
what once was rare is now routine.
Further, collection, storage, and analysis of monitoring weather data and the impacts of extreme
weather events on TSMO, maintenance, and emergency managers (e.g., through post-event
assessments and documentation) may be integrated into existing asset management systems or other
systems to facilitate continuous or on-demand evaluation of the effectiveness of existing practices.
This can also help to assess the need to revisit assumptions, underlying data, approaches, or program
goals and objectives articulated at the outset.

Getting Started: Data Collection Best Practices
The more transportation agencies understand the effects of weather events on their system and how
those events are changing over time, the better they can make decisions about how to plan for or
otherwise manage these events.
Understanding changing weather effects requires collecting data and other metrics. Departments of
transportation (DOTs) routinely collect and analyze large amounts of data on their operations and
systems. As a result, the most effective way to collect additional information that will enable DOTs to
learn about the effects of climate change will be to integrate data collection and analysis into existing
processes. Potential existing processes that could serve as a “home” for weather and climate tracking
include asset management programs, work order or labor tracking systems, weather severity indices,
and performance measures.
Asset Management Programs
State DOTs are in the process of developing risk-based Transportation Asset Management Plans
(TAMPs), in fulfillment of Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (MAP-21) requirements.
TAMPs and associated asset management systems provide an opportunity for DOTs to integrate climate
change risks alongside the other risks to transportation systems. Additional guidance is forthcoming
from the National Cooperative Highway Research Program (NCHRP) on integrating climate change and
extreme weather into TAMPs.29 Below are some steps DOTs can take to capitalize on their asset
management efforts to help inform their decision making around climate change.
 Incorporate fields into asset management system(s) to track the climate change or weather-related
vulnerabilities of each asset, if known through a vulnerability assessment.
 Configure the system to provide alerts when vulnerable assets are due for maintenance, repair, or replacement.
 Incorporate fields to help monitor vulnerabilities and effectiveness of adaptation over time. Example
fields may include:
• Maintenance instances, including specific cause (flooding, extreme heat, extreme cold, etc. – more
than just “weather-related”) and cost.
• Flooding frequency.
• Work order frequency.

Work Orders or Labor Tracking Systems
DOTs typically have systems in place to track employee activities and expenses, at least to an extent.
DOTs can leverage these systems to better track the impacts of weather events over time by creating work
order numbers, charge codes, or similar codes tied specifically to weather events.
 Set up work order codes for:
• Individual weather events (specific storms), or
• Categories of weather events (heat, snow/ice, rain, storm).
 Instruct staff to charge their time and expenses to the appropriate work order code. This will allow tracking
of agency costs including:
• Labor costs – regular and overtime.
• Contractor costs.
• Materials costs.
• Equipment costs.
 Associate societal impacts the agency is already monitoring with specific weather events or event types.
These impacts may include:
• Delays.
• Accidents.
• Fatalities.

Getting Started: Data Collection Best Practices (Continued)
Using Work Order Numbers to Track Weather Event Costs
The Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA) began creating unique work order
numbers for weather events in 2012, beginning with Hurricane Sandy.
SEPTA created a unique work order number in advance of the storm and instructed staff to use that
number for any time or materials spent on storm preparation, response, and recovery.
As a result, SEPTA captured a much fuller picture of the impacts of Sandy on their operations than they
had for previous storms. For example, SEPTA recorded more than $1.3 million in labor costs, nearly ten
times the labor costs recorded during previous tropical storms—storms that were much more destructive
to SEPTA than Sandy.

Assessment Pilot, Federal Transit Administration (FTA Report No. 0071). Available at: http://www.fta.dot.gov/documents/FTA_Report_
No._0071.pdf, accessed May 20, 2015.

Weather Severity Indices
Many DOTs (including Wisconsin, Indiana, Iowa, Idaho, Minnesota, and Ontario) maintain a “Winter
Severity Index” or similar metric that allows them to compare their seasonal expenditures to the relative
severity of winter weather.32 DOTs use these indices to identify efficiencies in winter weather response
over time and inform budget forecasts.
DOTs may consider tracking similar severity indices for other types of weather events that affect their
operations. For example:
 Summer severity index – This may include calculation of degree-days above a certain temperature
threshold, similar to how the energy sector tracks cooling degree-days.
 Flooding severity index.
 Wildfire season severity index.
 Storm season severity index – tracking the frequency and severity of convective thunderstorm or other
storms on a more seasonal basis.
 Drought severity index (these already exist in other sectors – such as the Palmer Drought Severity Index
– and would be available from the United States Drought Monitor or other agencies within the State).

44

Getting Started: Data Collection Best Practices (Continued)
In addition, DOTs may consider identifying specific impacts associated with climate changes and
tracking the frequency of these impacts over time. This could provide a way to simplify the data tracking
process by focusing on one or two key metrics of vulnerabilities over time, such as those in Table 9.
Table 9. Example Metrics to Track Impacts of Climate Stressors over Time.

Wind

Performance Measures
Finally, linking agency performance measures that are already tracked and analyzed to weather, where
appropriate, can be a good way to “mainstream” weather impact data collection. See Section III.E.I for
additional information on linking performance measures to climate change.

Potential Pitfalls of Data Collection
Potential (but avoidable) pitfalls to implementing any of these data collection strategies do exist.
Departments of transportation (DOTs) should note these possible drawbacks early and take steps to
avoid them.
 Data Storage - DOTs need the Information technology (IT) infrastructure to house what could become
potentially large datasets over time. Coordinate with the IT department to ensure the data collection
plan is sustainable from their perspective.
 Staff Time - Data cannot inform decision making without first being analyzed. Analysis of these data
sources needs to be expressly integrated into someone’s job in order for that analysis to happen. The
purpose of the approaches outlined above is to identify opportunities to integrate climate and weather
impact tracking data into existing data collection and analysis efforts to minimize the risk that data
go unused.

IV. Getting Started
This guide provides information and resources to help Department of transportation (DOT) transportation
systems management and operations (TSMO) and maintenance staff use TSMO, maintenance, and
emergency management activities to increase the resilience of their agency to extreme weather events and
climate change. The materials presented throughout this guide will help State DOTs and other
transportation agencies to better understand the risks that climate change poses and actions that can help
reduce those risks.
There is already sufficient information to begin a more concerted effort to evaluate programs and begin to
make or plan to make adjustments today. New information will also continue to emerge regarding
anticipated risks and strategies to address those risks. As it does and as the framework and concepts
presented in this guide are put into practice, it will be important to revisit and refine this guidance.
In the meantime, the specific resources and checklists provided throughout Section IV of this guide in the
“Getting Started” text boxes will enable users to use the segments of the guide best suited to their
individual needs, level of familiarity with climate change adaptation, and readiness to get started on
planning and implementing adaptation measures.

Description

1. Planning for
future workforce
needs

Determine the right
level of workforce
requirements and
capabilities

Operating and emergency
management agencies make a
variety of workforce-related
decisions, including the
number of staff required, their
locations, and the abilities
necessary to monitor, control,
report, and maintain the
roadway system.

Increased frequency of extreme events requires
additional personnel to monitor, control, report, and
respond to events. Changes in long-term climate
trends may also change seasonal work requirements
(e.g., changes in winter weather seasons, construction
timing, or landscaping timing) and additional or
unique staff expertise to monitor and respond to new
types of climate events (e.g., snow storm in Atlanta).

Long-term

2. Planning for
operations and
maintenance
investments

Determine criteria
to prioritize
operational resource
investments
(including capital
improvements)

Resource investments
may include new capital
improvements for operations
and maintenance such
as control systems, field
equipment, vehicles,
communications, and power.
They may also include
investments for annual
maintenance.

Capital improvements should be designed to withstand
the climate changes anticipated over their useful
life. For this reason, all climate stressors should be
considered to ensure investments will make it to the
end of their useful life. Whether features of a project
reduce its climate risk or reduce the climate risk of the
community (e.g., reduce flooding) would need to be
factored into decisions around which investments to
make. Additionally, capital investment needs may be
changing and therefore may require new identification
processes (e.g., increased flood monitors).

Long-term

3. Budgeting for
operations,
maintenance, and
emergency
management

Determine the
appropriate funding
needs and levels on
annual and multiyear basis

Operating and emergency
management agencies are
typically funded on an annual
basis. Funding levels are
a driving factor in overall
program capabilities and
functions.

Extreme events and long-term changes in climate can
affect resource requirements. For example, increases
in temperature can increase annual pavement
maintenance costs, or changes in freeze/thaw cycles
can increase potholes. Changes in winter weather
and increasing weather uncertainty could also affect
budgets. The future climate may require different
resource allocations and budget planning formulas
than today's climate.

Annual

4. Establishing
realistic
objectives

Set regional
operational
and emergency
management
objectives for the
program

Effective planning for
operations and emergency
management requires a
clear articulation of regional
operating objectives.
These objectives define
the response strategies and
the performance-based
management required.

Objectives and performance measures relating to
emergency response or return to level of service may
be affected by the frequency and severity of extreme
events. Additional measures on resilience might
be required to monitor and manage performance.
Additionally, changes in weather patterns may make
select past performance measures unrealistic. The
setting of realistic targets will need to be grounded in
an understanding of future weather conditions.

Siting equipment in areas that will be impacted by sea
level rise, ecological damage, flooding, snowfall, or
other climatic events may damage the infrastructure.
Climate change could also affect where agencies
choose to site new equipment. Flood risk over the
lifetime of the asset could be a criteria used to choose
sites for future equipment. Additionally, agencies
cannot afford to monitor all areas and assets that
will be impacted by climate change. Prioritization
methods and flexible mobile data sources (e.g., citizen
reporters, snow patrol reporting, mobile probes) will
need to be developed.

Long-term

Yes

Establishing adequate
communications and power,
especially redundancy in the
system, is critical to prevent
outages of the field and control
systems. The susceptibility of
communications and power
infrastructure to conditions
can limit the capability of
operational response.

Communication and power lines are sensitive to
icing, flooding, and extreme temperatures (e.g.,
rolling blackouts during heat waves). Flooding can
also damage back-up power systems. Storms can
bring down tree lines which damage power and
communication lines. Agencies will need to consider
whether their existing communication and power
requirements are resilient to climate change. Snow can
cover or block communications (e.g., stop lights and
cameras).

Long-term

No

Ecological Effects

Closely related to the type
of equipment is the correct

private sector data, other
monitoring systems such
as Environmental Sensing
Stations are greatly affected
by the siting criteria.

infiltration. Climate change may also require agencies
to monitor additional stressors/conditions in order
to understand how they may affect the agency in the
future. Early monitoring of climate change stressors
could improve agency abilities to make decisions in
the long-term.

Storm Surge

Monitoring field conditions is
vital to effective operations
and emergency management.

Determine the

and precision of
inspection protocols

Inspection protocols
are a vital part of asset
management. For operating
agencies, these include the
full range of transportation
assets from structures to
communication networks.
Due to resource constraints,
agencies need to develop a
protocol designed to prioritize
the key assets being managed.

Climate stressors can lead to increased asset
deterioration, requiring more frequent inspections.
However, inspections are very expensive and time
consuming. Knowledge of climatic trends may allow
for focused scoping of the level of precision and
frequency of various types of inspections.

A variety of pavement
rehabilitation decisions are
made on a seasonal basis
ranging from full-depth
replacement, to levelling and
coating. Decisions pertaining
to life-cycle cost of such
treatments, the timing of these
treatments, and the materials
used are all topics of concern
to decision makers.

Pavements are designed to withstand particular
temperature thresholds. High temperatures may
lead to rutting, while cold (and freezing) conditions
increase potholes. This may necessitate changing the

Bridges with joints and moveable parts are more
susceptible to damage due to their sensitivity to
temperature and water infiltration. Increased rainfall
and flooding can also increase bridge scour or lead

Decisions involving overall
right-of-way maintenance
such as vegetation control,
drainage, and culvert
management are included
in this area. Often deferred
due to resource constraints,
effective decisions in this area
may in fact be more critical
to operational capability than
anticipated.

Vegetation control: Increased rain (in some parts of
the country) paired with increased temperatures can
lead to additional vegetation growth and death. This
dry fuel poses wildfire hazards. Some areas may begin
to experience drought and need to plant more droughttolerant vegetation.
Drainage and culverts: Following wildfires, rainstorms
can increase debris flow and block or flood culverts
and drainage systems. Heavy rainstorms can blow out
undersized drainage. In coastal settings, sea level rise
may surcharge the drainage systems.

procurement

Agencies spent a significant
portion of their budget on
materials. Procurement
decisions ranging from
timing, type of material, and
the length of the contract
duration greatly affect the
overall cost as well as the
actual season.

If supplies are under-purchased during particularly
bad seasons, it may be difficult to obtain the necessary
materials for response. Frequently, after an extreme
weather event (e.g., ice storm or hurricane), supplies
can run short and distribution lines can be disrupted.
Likewise, if response contracts are too short then
agencies may not be prepared to respond to late season
extreme weather events (e.g., flooding, extreme heat,
snow).

Appendix B. Additional Resources
Many resources are provided throughout this document. This appendix provides a few additional
resources that may be of interest and use to agencies seeking to embark on adaptation planning.

A. Federal Highway Administration Virtual Framework
The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA)
“Virtual Framework for Vulnerability
Assessment” (Virtual Framework) is an
interactive web version of FHWA’s 2012
Climate Change and Extreme Weather
Vulnerability Assessment Framework. The
Virtual Framework provides guidance to State
departments of transportation (DOTs) and
other transportation agencies on how to assess
and address their vulnerabilities to climate
change. The Virtual Framework breaks the
vulnerability assessment process into six
modules: Articulate Objectives, Identify Key
Climate Variables, Characterize and Select
Assets, Assess Vulnerabilities, Integrate
Vulnerabilities into Decision Making, and
Monitor and Revisit.

Figure 13. Screenshot. FHWA Virtual Framework
for Vulnerability Assessment.

Each module contains step-by-step guidance,
video testimonials from professionals sharing
lessons on their experience, case studies related to the framework step, links to resources related to the
step, and tools to help a user complete the step. The Virtual Framework is primarily focused on assessing
and addressing infrastructure-related vulnerabilities, but offers several resources that can prove useful to
adapting TSMO and maintenance practices. This guide identifies specific resources within the Virtual
Framework as they apply to the steps outlined herein. Readers are encouraged to explore the Virtual
Framework for additional resources that may be relevant to their organization. The Virtual Framework is
available at: http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/environment/adaptationframework.

B. Existing Benefit-Cost Assessment Tools
A number of guidance documents and tools for conducting cost benefit assessments are available for the
transportation sector. Some guidance documents, like United States Department of Transportation's
(USDOT’s) Asset Management Primer or Operations Benefit/cost Analysis Desk Reference, are intended
to inform a particular type of decision or decision maker, but do not address adaptation and extreme events
directly. Some, like National Cooperative Highway Research Program (NCHRP) Report 750, Climate
Change, Extreme Weather Events, and the Highway System, provide a high-level discussion of climaterisk-adjusted benefit-cost-methodology, but do not provide a comprehensive set of resources or guidance
for each step of the analysis. The various tools that exist—such as BCA.net or the Hazard Mitigation Cost
Effectiveness (HMCE) tool—also vary in their audiences, in the types of inputs and outputs they produce,
in the scalability of the projects they can evaluate, and in their ability to capture extreme events or climate
change. A sampling of existing tools and resources is shown in the box below.

Appendix C. Future Research Needs
This guide begins to lay out how climate change will impact transportation systems management and
operations (TSMO) and maintenance and provides actionable steps that practitioners can take to prepare
their programs; however, there are still many topics that require additional research and development. In
order to identify the remaining gaps in knowledge, the following table presents existing needs in TSMO
and maintenance capabilities to address climate change, the actions that need to be undertaken to move
toward a climate resilient program, and the research that remains to be completed to allow departments of
transportation (DOTs) to take informed actions to close the gaps.

Have sufficient resources to prepare
in advance for the coming season
in terms of labor, equipment, and
materials. Stockpile extreme weather
response materials and supplies
in advance of extreme events.
Redistribute materials prior to an
extreme weather event to ensure
efficient access to needed supplies.
Consider the life-cycle cost
effectiveness of resiliency investments
in budgeting and design. Use asset
management systems to track relevant
information to inform decisionmaking over time.

DOT personnel are constrained in their ability to
justify increases in current budgets, despite potential
savings over time. They have limited information and
tools to determine the long-term cost effectiveness
of actively investing in resiliency during routine
maintenance versus responding after issues arise.

Consider potential future climatic
conditions (and associated
uncertainty) when setting TSMO and
maintenance budgets and workforce
planning.

DOTs rely on historic weather data in their decision
making. They do not have sufficient long-range (1-3
months or 1-3 years) meteorological forecasts to use in
their budget setting process. They face both a lack of
data in addition to a lack of understanding of how to
use uncertain climate projections in decision making.

DOT weather maintenance budgets are frequently
insufficient to allow for the advanced preparation for
extreme events such as investing in equipment, investing
in labor, and stockpiling materials and supplies (e.g.,
culverts) prior to a damaging event; however, after
extreme events, supply chains are frequently disrupted,
materials may be in short supply, and the rushed nature
of ordering after an emergency can increase costs. This
results in delays in repairing and reopening roadways.

Track the reason for damage and the
cost of repair, and incorporate that
information (e.g., Winter Severity
Indices) into budgeting processes.

Actions Toward a Climate-Resilient
Program

Departments of transportation (DOTs) often do not
track the costs of maintenance or damage related to
weather events, which limits their ability to understand
changing costs over time (e.g., related to repeated
repairs due to recurring impacts).

Link climate change considerations
to asset management systems and
use a strategic approach to prioritize
investments between improving
operations on the average day
and improving operations during
extreme weather events. Additionally,
prioritize investments and changes
in practices that benefit both the near
and short term.
Use a combination of on-the-ground
staff (and potentially citizens),
sensors, and mobile technology to
gain comprehensive coverage of realtime weather and roadway conditions.
Take full advantage of TSMO
technologies both during daily
recurrent traffic conditions as well as
during extreme weather events.
Use MDSS or other existing tools to
run a series of hypothetical future
storm events in order to inform
operational planning exercises. Use
detailed road weather projections
to project further out in order to
inform an event-specific staging and
response.
Develop MDSS systems that cover
weather events such has floods and
heat waves.

Many DOTs have significant gaps in coverage of
weather and road weather conditions. This makes it
difficult to make informed decisions during extreme
weather events.

Many DOTs optimize their signal timing and other
TSMO tools for managing recurrent delay rather
than managing extreme weather events. While this
approach is effective for increasing reliability, it
might not be the best approach for using these tools to
increase resiliency to weather events.

DOTs need a projection period of more than a
few days to fully prepare a response to a weather
event. Existing tools (e.g., theMaintenance Decision
Support System [MDSS] program) are available
only for winter weather and currently only project
weather conditions 2 to 3 days out (and have limited
geographic scope).

Practitioners other than winter maintenance managers
do not have decision support systems in place to
manage the system based on near-term or longer-term
weather.

Actions Toward a Climate-Resilient
Program

DOT TSMO programs traditionally focus on
improving daily operations (e.g., managing recurrent
delay) rather than proactively developing systems and
protocols for managing extreme weather events. They
are unaware of how adapting TSMO and maintenance
to climate change differs from (and is linked to)
routine preparation for extreme weather events.

account for the potential impacts of climate change.
It may become more difficult to meet existing
performance measures and targets with a changing
climate.

TSMO, maintenance, and emergency management
staff is unaware of how climate change may impact
their operations, both in the near term and the future.
There is also inconsistent agreement among State
DOTs that climate change is a real threat that needs to
be integrated into decision making.

DOTs have difficulty managing expectations from the
public for ever-clear roads, which is in direct conflict
with decreasing State funding and more frequent
extreme weather events.

DOTs are historically risk averse and do not want to
change practices until they are required to (as a result
of breakdowns in the existing system).

Actions Toward a Climate-Resilient
Program

DOTs are unaware of how they could adapt their
practices and technology to respond to climate
change.

Gap

Continue to identify barriers to and
best practices for changing DOT
culture to accept the need for climate
resilience.

Best practices on community
engagement and discussion.

Continued research on the impacts
of climate change on specific
elements of TSMO programs. Further
documentation of climate-sensitive
TSMO and maintenance decisions.

Develop a framework for assessing
how climate change may impact
agencies ability to manage the
projected risks posed by severe
weather within established levels
of risk tolerance (i.e., when will
traditional tactics used for routine
events be insufficient?). Include
how to assess the agency’s current
capability to handle threats.

DOTs need a database of potential
adaptation activities and best practices
for consideration to help understand
the range of options. While we
can begin to provide these list of
options, future research will need to
develop implementation time frames,
partners, co-benefits, and cost of
implementation assessments.

Share data and qualitative lessons
learned on frequent problem areas
and proposed actions to mitigate these
issues.
Ensure all TSMO, maintenance,
and emergency management staff
understands how climate change and
extreme weather affect their day-today ability to efficiently complete
their jobs. With this understanding
should come internal initiative to
increase resiliency to these events.
Add new job classifications to the
workforce, such as meteorologists,
hybrid engineer/environmentalist,
people from other hybrid disciplines,
TSMO managers, risk experts,
emergency managers with both
a transportation/emergency
management background, etc.

Regularly coordinate between on-theground staff and other departments to
discuss "hot spot" areas and inform
investment decisions based on past
performance.

DOT staff currently report that they are overburdened
by current job responsibilities and have limited
to no capacity or training to take on additional
responsibilities, such as climate change risk and
vulnerability assessments and developing adaptation
responses.

DOT staff does not necessarily have the skill sets
necessary to incorporate climate change into day-today operations.

In addition to not tracking the quantitative costs of
responding to extreme weather events, most DOTs
also do not record qualitative information that
comes from years of professional staff experience.
This makes it hard to retain historic, qualitative
information when staff retire or move on.

Actions Toward a Climate-Resilient

Information is not always full reported as to where
problems repeatedly arise and why. This lack of
information sharing limits the ability of TSMO,

environment in a way that effectively uses beneficial opportunities or reduces negative effects. (FHWA
Order 5520)
Adaptive Capacity. The ability of a system to adjust to climate change (including climate variability
and extremes) to moderate potential damages, to take advantage of opportunities, or to cope with the
consequences. (FHWA Gulf Coast Study, Phase 1)
Capability Maturity Framework (CMF). The CMF is based on self-evaluation regarding the key
process and institutional capabilities required from a transportation agency (or group of agencies) to
achieve effective TSMO. This framework is adapted from a concept developed in the information
technology industry called the Capability Maturity Model (CMM), which has been tailored to the
transportation community. The CMF identifies the six key dimensions of process and institutional
capability that directly relate to improving program effectiveness: business processes; systems and
technology; performance measurement; culture; organization and workforce; collaboration. (FHWA,
Creating an Effective Program to Advance TSMO Primer)
Change Averse. A strong opposition to changing practices or beliefs.
Climate Change. Climate change refers to any significant change in the measures of climate lasting for an
extended period of time. Climate change includes major variations in temperature, precipitation, or wind
patterns, among other environmental conditions, that occur over several decades or longer. Changes in
climate may manifest as a rise in sea level, as well as increase the frequency and magnitude of extreme
weather events now and in the future. (FHWA Order 5520)
Climate Stressor. Acute and long-term weather events and trends that have an effect on an asset or
service. Among others, stressors include extreme temperature events and precipitation events, drought,
sea level rise, storm surge, intense storms (e.g., hurricanes and tropical storms), strong winds, blizzards,
humidity, permafrost thaw, and long-term temperature and precipitation trends. (FHWA Gulf Coast,
Phase 1)
Efficacy. The extent to which the strategy, if successfully implemented, reduces the risk. (NYSERDA
Responding to Climate Change in New York State [ClimAID])
Emergency Management. The process of preventing, preparing for, responding to, and recovering from
an emergency; where an emergency is an unexpected, large-scale, damaging event. (TRB Regional TSMO
Committee’s Glossary)
Exposure. The nature and degree to which a system or asset is exposed to significant climate variations.
(FHWA, Gulf Coast Study, Phase 2)
Extreme Weather Events. Extreme weather events can include significant anomalies in temperature,
precipitation and winds and can manifest as heavy precipitation and flooding, heatwaves, drought,
wildfires and windstorms (including tornadoes and tropical storms). Consequences of extreme weather
events can include safety concerns, damage, destruction, and economic loss. Climate change can also
cause or influence extreme weather events. (FHWA Order 5520)

69

Extreme Events. For the purposes of this directive, the term “extreme events” refers to risks posed by
climate change and extreme weather events. The definition does not apply to other uses of the term nor
include consideration of risks to the transportation system from other natural hazards, accidents, or other
human induced disruptions. (FHWA Order 5520)
Feasibility. How practical it is for a particular strategy to be implemented by a department, accounting for
engineering, policy, legal, and insurance considerations. (NYSERDA Responding to Climate Change in
New York State [ClimAID])
Flexibility. Ability to make course corrections if a particular strategy is adopted. Such corrections are an
essential part of adaptive management. (NYSERDA Responding to Climate Change in New York State
[ClimAID])
Performance Measurement. A process of assessing progress toward achieving predetermined goals.
(TRB Regional TSMO Committee’s Glossary)
Performance Measures. Indicators that provide the basis for evaluating the transportation system
operating conditions and identifying the location and severity of congestion and other problems. (TRB
Regional TSMO Committee’s Glossary)
Preparedness. Actions taken to plan, organize, equip, train, and exercise to build, apply, and sustain the
capabilities necessary to prevent, protect against, ameliorate the effects of, respond to, and recover from
climate change related damages to life, health, property, livelihoods, ecosystems, and national security.
(FHWA Order 5520)
Projection. A climate projection is the simulated response of the climate system to a scenario of future
emission or concentration of greenhouse gases (GHGs) and aerosols, generally derived using climate
models. (IPCC Glossary)
Resilience. Resilience or resiliency is the ability to anticipate, prepare for, and adapt to changing
conditions and withstand, respond to, and recover rapidly from disruptions. (FHWA Order 5520)
Risk Aversion. The behavior of humans while exposed to uncertainty to attempt to reduce that uncertainty.
(Wikipedia)
Road Weather Management. Mitigation strategies employed in response to various weather threats
including fog, high winds, snow, rain, ice, flooding, tornadoes, hurricanes, and avalanches. (TRB Regional
TSMO Committee’s Glossary)
Scenario. A plausible description of how the future may develop based on a coherent and internally
consistent set of assumptions about key driving forces (e.g., rate of technological change, prices) and
relationships. Note that scenarios are neither predictions nor forecasts, but are useful to provide a view of
the implications of developments and actions. (IPCC Glossary)
Scenario Planning. Scenario planning provides a framework for developing a shared vision for the future
by analyzing various forces (e.g., climate change, land use, economy) that affect growth and management
of the transportation system. Scenario planning tests various future alternatives in order to identify
solutions that meet state and community needs under a variety of potential futures. Scenario planning is
used in exercises to make critical decisions in the face of uncertainty. (FHWA Scenario Planning and
Visualization in Transportation)

change. (FHWA Gulf Cost Study, Phase 2)
Transportation Asset Management (TAM). A strategic and systematic process of operating, maintaining,
upgrading, and expanding physical assets effectively through their life cycle. It focuses on business and
engineering practices for resource allocation and utilization, with the objective of better decision making
based upon quality information and well defined objectives. (TRB Regional TSMO Committee’s Glossary)
Transportation Management Center (TMC). The hub of a transportation management and control
system. The TMC brings together human and technological components from various agencies to perform
a variety of functions. (TRB Regional TSMO Committee’s Glossary)
Transportation Systems Management and Operations (TSMO). An integrated program to optimize the
performance of existing infrastructure through the implementation of systems, services, and projects
designed to preserve capacity and improve security, safety, and reliability of the transportation system.
(TRB Regional TSMO Committee’s Glossary)
Vulnerability. The degree to which a transportation system or asset is susceptible to, and unable to cope
with, adverse effects of climate change, variability, and extremes. Vulnerability is a function of exposure,
sensitivity, and adaptive capacity. (FHWA Gulf Coast Study, Phase 2)

Appendix E. Sample Handout for Workshop
on Climate Change Risk
This sample worksheet provides the basic format and
illustrative examples for a workshop to explore
climate change risk. The goal of conducting such a
workshop is to develop a more complete
understanding of the direct and indirect impacts and
costs associated with extreme weather events. Then,
this information can be folded back into practices
used by the offices and departments represented at
the exercise (using the approaches suggested in the
guide above).

Scenarios
SCENARIO 1:

Source: Southeastern Pennsylvania
Transportation Authority

Figure 14. Photo. Flooding at Spring Mill Station
on Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation
Authority's Manayunk/Norristown Regional
Rail Line in Philadelphia.

[Description of local past extreme weather event. For
example: Between August 26 and September 3, 2011,
Greater Philadelphia was hit with two tropical storm-force weather events – Hurricane Irene and Tropical
Storm Lee. These storms brought with them torrential rainfall and strong winds across the Philadelphia
region. The storms followed the wettest month (August 2011) in the region’s history. The saturated ground
exacerbated impacts.]
SCENARIO 2:
[To develop a scenario that addresses climate change risk, begin with a severe weather event familiar to
the participants.]
SCENARIO 3:
[To develop a scenario that addresses climate change risk, begin with a severe weather event familiar to
the participants.]

Exercise
The purpose of this exercise is to develop a more complete understanding of the direct and indirect impacts
and costs associated with extreme weather events by retracing the department of transportation (DOTs)
response before, during, and after these events, from advance warning from the National Weather Service
to resumption of normal service and everything in between. We are interested in the responses of all
affected departments.

Sample Discussion Questions:
 How prepared are we for heavy rain events today?
• When we receive advance warning of a heavy rain event:
∘∘ At what stage (x inches of rain predicted, etc.) does your department consider escalating its
responsive actions?
∘∘ What responses are triggered?
∘∘ What personnel are involved in heavy rain event preparations (either for actual response actions
or continuity of those operations for which you are responsible)?
∘∘ What contractors and staff are put on notice in heavy rain event preparations?
∘∘ What materials and equipment are put on standby?
∘∘ How are standby locations determined/prioritized?
∘∘ Under what conditions are you concerned that you may not be adequately prepared for the
event? What elements of your department are not prepared?
• When the heavy rain event is occurring:
∘∘ What actions are your personnel directed to take?
∘∘ What personnel are engaged in the response?
∘∘ At what points are contractors engaged?
∘∘ What triggers use of materials and equipment or alternate locations?
∘∘ What triggers decisions to discontinue service (for a particular operation or for the agency)?
• When the heavy rain event is over:
∘∘ What inspections/audits are conducted to evaluate impacts?
∘∘ How are corrective actions planned?
∘∘ How are operations resumed?
∘∘ To what extent does “mitigation” of future impacts factor into corrective actions?
∘∘ Do you have examples of actions that have been taken in the past after an event?
∘∘ What “lessons learned” have emerged from past events that have not been integrated into the
standard response plan?
• What other indirect costs are associated with the DOTs response to a heavy rain event?
 What data do you collect and retain about past incidents? Based on our current responses, if heavy rain
events were to occur more frequently in the future:
•
•

Is there new technology or equipment that you would need to be better prepared?
Are there specific locations within your jurisdiction that you should be increasing your planning for?
Would you need to change your contracting and bidding processes?
How could you reduce costs per event?
What additional workforce training would make you more prepared?
How can you better inform the public of disruptions?
What operational changes would improve your response and efficiency?
How can you be better prepared before an event?
How do you prepare to mobilize quickly for unexpected events?
What impact would additional events have on your equipment and assets?
Who should you improve coordination with and how?
How can you better track costs and impacts from these events?

Appendix F. Adaptation Checklist for
Technical Staff
Additional Resources
For further information on how to run an exercise of this sort, (particularly how to manage a tabletop
exercise), see: http://ops.fhwa.dot.gov/publications/tabletopexercpe/tabletopexererc_ pse.pdf.
The adaptation framework presented earlier in the guide provides an overview of how transportation
systems management and operations (TSMO) and maintenance groups can begin to take action through
steps to: define the scope of adaptation efforts; assess vulnerabilities to inform the development of
adaptation strategies; and integrate climate change into decision making. The checklist that follows provides
further detail on specific actions that can help move technical staff through these steps.
Define Scope
□ Define TSMO and maintenance program goals and operations objectives that could be sensitive to
climate change.
□ Identify the extreme weather events or trends that could affect the agency’s TSMO and maintenance
programs.
Assess Vulnerability
□ Catalog current capabilities (both technical and institutional).
□ Review traffic incident reports, maintenance records, after-action reports, emergency reimbursement
forms, and other sources to determine how extreme weather events have affected performance in the past.
□ Interview staff across departments about extreme weather-related vulnerabilities
(e.g., “what keeps you up at night?”).
□ Identify points and thresholds where extreme weather affects TSMO and maintenance decisions (e.g.,
establishing future workforce needs, weather response budgeting, setting operational objectives).
□ Document how TSMO and maintenance practices relate to different weather thresholds (e.g., place
sandbags when forecast calls for X amount of rain).
□ Gather information on historic trends in relevant weather variables and/or how those variables may
change in the future.
□ Characterize extreme weather risks via data-driven or workshop-based qualitative or quantitative analysis.
Integrate into Decision Making
□ Identify performance measures and targets (i.e., the acceptable level of operational performance if
threat occurs).
□ Select potential adaptation strategies (selected examples provided below – see more in Tables 6 and 8
in the guide).
Policy-based strategy examples
□ Review and update performance measures in light of extreme weather vulnerabilities.
□ Establish work order codes for weather events or use other methods to improve tracking of labor,
equipment, and materials costs over time.
□ Develop a strategy for incorporating weather trends in budget-setting processes.
□ Require after-action reports with clear recommendations for improvement following extreme events.
□ Update emergency response plans to factor in potential for greater frequency of extreme weather events.
□ Improve cross-training across staff (including across operations, maintenance, and emergency
management).
75

□ Establish regular coordination between on-the-ground staff and other departments to discuss
vulnerabilities and inform investment decisions based on past performance.
□ Establish transition plans for retiring staff to maintain institutional knowledge.
□ Modify current design and procurement criteria to favor durable materials and designs.
Operational and maintenance strategy examples
□ Establish stand-by contracts for extreme event response.
□ Improve intra-agency coordination and information sharing about conditions, closures, resources, etc.
□ Enhance inter-agency coordination to promote establishment of resource-sharing agreements and
information sharing about plans, initiatives, risks, and resources (e.g., include key stakeholders in
routine communications to streamline process during emergency events).
□ Invest in redundant communications systems and data servers.
□ Expand both coverage and quality of fixed and mobile monitoring capabilities.
□ Modify procurement specifications to ensure performance over a wider range of conditions.
Maintenance strategy examples
□ Purchase equipment, factoring in likely future needs based on extreme weather events or climate
changes (e.g., versatile equipment in Alabama to double as snow plows, mobile stockpiles of traffic
control devices).
□ Stockpile materials (e.g., culvert pipe, temporary bridge components, fuel) and equipment (e.g.,
generators, chain saws, traffic control devices) and stage them in strategic areas prior to events.
□ Increase or change vegetation control practices to keep pace with climate changes (e.g., increase
trimming frequency or plant more drought- or heat-tolerant species).
□ Review and consider mitigating vulnerabilities when conducting scheduled maintenance activities.
Emergency management strategy examples.
□ Incorporate changes in extreme event frequency into emergency management planning, including
anticipated staffing, training, and equipment needs.
□ Establish stand-by contracts for extreme event response.
□ Conduct tabletop exercises and use routine events to drill emergency management protocols.
Adaptive management strategy examples
□ Develop a system to track weather-related trends and costs over time (e.g., number of potholes repaired,
snow removal costs, number of emergency event triggers, labor hours devoted to weather preparation,
response, and recovery), such as through designated “weather-related” charge codes.
□ Use asset management systems to track relevant information to inform decision making over time.
□ Configure asset management or maintenance systems to issue alerts when vulnerable assets are due for
maintenance, repair, or replacement.
□ Develop and track performance metrics related to extreme weather (e.g., number/duration of weatherrelated road closures).
□ Evaluate and select adaptation strategies based on factors such as technical and political feasibility, costs
and benefits, efficacy, flexibility, and sustainability.
□ Determine improvements in agency capabilities necessary for successful implementation of adaptation
strategies (e.g., improvements in business processes, systems and technologies, performance
management, culture, organization and workforce, and collaboration).
Monitor Progress and Revisit
□ Establish a plan for monitoring and evaluating progress toward extreme weather resilience.
□ Engage stakeholders needed to support monitoring and evaluation efforts.
□ Monitor trends in extreme weather events and their impacts (e.g., frequency of particular events,
weather-related costs and disruptions).
□ Analyze data on weather trends and impacts to inform decision-making about future strategies.
□ Continually revisit TSMO, maintenance, and emergency programs in light of extreme weather and
climate trends.
