## Summary of Module
This module discusses some methods in Computational Social Science, and the influence of Data Analytics in Political Science and other Social Science disciplines. Computational Social Science uses computational methods to approach social science questions; for data analytics, data is collected, stored, analyzed, and visualized to better understand patterns in human behavior and action. In both applied politics and academic political science research, computational techniques have gained considerable traction for the purposes of analyzing causal relationships, making useful classifications, and forecasting.

## Learning Goals
- Explain what it means to use Twitter as data.
- List some of the ways scholars and campaigns are using Twitter data.
- Understand the basic technical details behind how you get your computer to access Twitter data, structure it (and what this means!), and analyze it.
- Discuss both the promises and pitfall of using Twitter as data.
    
## Learning Objectives
In this module the students will learn the basics of using Twitter data. Students will see the Python coding used to analyze data scrapped from Twitter. Students will then use Python to analyze and visualize the data in various ways - including counting words and performing sentiment analysis. Students will then be able to discuss the advantages and perils of using Twitter data for social science research.
