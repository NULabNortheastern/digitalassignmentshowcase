# Twitter Analysis

## Individual Class Info
This module was prepared for the Economics Department.

## Summary of Module
This module discusses some methods in Computational Social Science, and the influence of Data Analytics in Political Science and other Social Science disciplines. Computational Social Science uses computational methods to approach social science questions; for data analytics, data is collected, stored, analyzed, and visualized to better understand patterns in human behavior and action. In both applied politics and academic political science research, computational techniques have gained considerable traction for the purposes of analyzing causal relationships, making useful classifications, and forecasting.

## Learning Goals
- Explain what it means to use Twitter as data
- List some of the ways scholars and campaigns are using Twitter data
- Understand the basic technical details behind how you get your computer to access Twitter data, structure it (and what this means!), and analyze it
- Discuss both the promises and pitfall of using Twitter as data

## Learning Objectives
This module is framed as a broad discussion of what Twitter data is and what people are doing with the data itself. Then, the module takes a peak behind the hood of twitter and shows basics of Twitter data scrapping and text analysis basics. Students will then see a broad exploration of Twitter data and see what is possible with the data including computation text analysis. The module then concludes with a discussion of the perils and possibilities of using Twitter data for social science research.
