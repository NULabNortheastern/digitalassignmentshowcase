    "# FBI Application Programming Interface (API) Module\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will be using Python to access the FBI's Application Programming Interface (API) to retrieve data from their servers to use in our research. APIs are powerful tools that many websites use for data storage and access. It will not be long before online data is primarily retrieved via APIs, so it is important to know the basic structure and skills required to do so.\n",

    "## Important Terminology\n",
    "<b> Application Programming Interface (API):</b> Functions that allow for access to features or data of an operating system, applications, or online services. <br>\n",
    "<b> Data Scraping:</b> The process of using an API to import or download data from a website into a local machine. <br>\n",
    "<b> API Key:</b> APIs require an access key that behaves like a password to identify users who are accessing the data. <b> Do not</b> share your API key with anyone, nor make it accessible or visible in a public presentation or Jupyter Notebook. <br>\n",
    "<b> Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR):</b> The FBI's nationwide data collection and information system that reports crime statistics.<br>\n",
    "<b> Crime Data Explorer (CDE):</b> The public facing database for the UCR.<br>\n",
    "<b> National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS):</b> A new system the FBI is implementing nationwide for data collection. However, only some municipalities have adopted it so far, but the goal is to have all agencies reporting NIBRS statistics by 2021.<br>\n",
    "<b> Summary Reporting System (SRS):</b> The current FBI standard for agencies reporting crime statistics. SRS is being replaced by the more-specific NIBRS statistics.<br>\n",

Then once you have identifying data, you can use the other URL extensions to more in-depth searches of the specific data."
