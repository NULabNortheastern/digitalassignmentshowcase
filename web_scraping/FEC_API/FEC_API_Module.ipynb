    "# FEC Application Programming Interface (API) Module\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, I will be walking you through how to use the Federal Election Commission's (FEC) API. APIs are powerful tools that many websites use for data storage and access. It will not be long before online data is primarily retrieved via APIs, so it is important to know the basic structure and skills required to do so. We will use the FEC API to first look up candidates in the Connecticut 2018 midterm election for the house of representatives to get a candidate ID given by the FEC. Then we will use a candidate ID to look up that candidate's history of campaign finance for as long as the representative has been in office. Finally, we will plot the total disbursements per campaign cycle.\n",

    "## Important Terminology\n",
    "<b> Application Programming Interface (API):</b> Functions that allow for access to features or data of an operating system, applications, or online services. <br>\n",
    "<b> Data Scraping:</b> The process of using an API to import or download data from a website into a local machine. <br>\n",
    "<b> API Key:</b> APIs require an access key that behaves like a password to identify users who are accessing the data. <b> Do not</b> share your API key with anyone, nor make it accessible or visible in a public presentation or Jupyter Notebook. <br>\n",

    "The FEC API gives us the ability to look up campaign spending as well as many other variables. Representative John B. Larson, a Democrat from Connecticut's first district, spent nearly 2.5 million dollars in the 2010 election cycle, the peak of his campaign spending. 2010 spending may have been expenses necessary to fight off a Tea Party insurgent Republican or perhaps another campaign reason like the *Citizens United* ruling. Note that this spending is only from Representative Larson's campaign itself and does not include other spending like from Political Action Committees."
