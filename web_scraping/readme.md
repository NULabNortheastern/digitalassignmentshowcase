# Web Scraping Using APIs
## Summary of Module
This a generic API web scraping module. An API, or application programming interface, is a set of subroutine definitions, communication protocols, and tools for building software that ultimately allows applications to communicate with one another. An API may be for a web-based system, operating system, database system, computer hardware, or software library. This module consists of a general presentation teaching the basics of API usage as well as multiple API-specific Jupyter Notebooks that demonstrate step-by-step how to use a variety of APIs for web-scraping.

## Learning Goals
Students will learn the purpose and methods for using APIs to retrieve data from internet sources for use in research and analysis. Students will learn the general basics of web scraping in a presentation, then be able to see how different APIs are used for gathering data from web sources.
## Learning Objectives
- Understand the definition and purpose of an API and web-scraping.
- Understand the syntax of APIs and the importance of API documentation.
- Learn steps of the specific API of interest.
